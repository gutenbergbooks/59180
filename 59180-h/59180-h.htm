<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>Every man has a genius for something or other.
I have a genius for a comfortable armchair and a
blazing fire. Add to these two ingredients what
Bob Cratchit would call a <span class='it'>circle</span> of congenial companions
(meaning, as his considerate creator points
out, a <span class='it'>semi-circle</span>) and I am as destitute of envy
as the Miller of the Dee. I stipulate, however, that
my companions shall be so very much to my taste
that, when in the mood, I can talk to my heart's
content without seeming garrulous, and, when in
the mood, can remain as silent as the Sphinx without
appearing sullen.</p>

<p>This outrageous spasm of autobiography is
necessitated as an explanation of <span class='it'>Rubble and Roseleaves</span>.
The contents are neither essays nor sermons
nor anything of the kind. The inexhaustible patience
of my readers has lured me into the habit of talking
on any mortal—or immortal—subject that takes
my fancy. I have merely set down here a few
wayward notions that have, in the course of my
wanderings, occurred to me. But, in self-defense,
let me add that these outbursts have been punctuated
by whole infinitudes of silence. The silences
are eloquently represented by the gaps between
the chapters.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>I—OLD ENVELOPES</h1>

<p>Three envelopes, cruelly torn and sadly crumpled,
look reproachfully up at me from the yawning
abyss of my waste-paper basket. There is a
heavy, pompous envelope, of foolscap size, who
evidently feels that I have affronted his dignity
by casting him to the void in this unceremonious
way. There is a thin, blue envelope who seems to
be barking out something about an account that
ought to be paid. And there is a dainty little square
envelope, delicately perfumed, and addressed in a
lady's flowing hand. This pretty piece of stationery
keeps asking, in a plaintive voice, if the age of
chivalry is dead.</p>

<p>'<span class='it'>Why</span>,' these envelopes want to know, '<span class='it'>why are
the letters that we brought laid so respectfully on
your desk whilst we, to whom you are so much indebted,
are crushed and mangled and tossed disdainfully
aside? Isn't an envelope as good as a letter
any day?</span>'</p>

<p>There is justice in their contention, and I take
up my pen that I may tender them an apology.
A letter will tell you much; but the envelope will
often tell you more. I remember sitting with John
Broadbanks one autumn afternoon on the broad
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
verandah of the Mosgiel Manse. Some important
meetings were to be held next day, and he had
driven over to help me in my preparations for them.
He had, moreover, arranged to stay the night. As
we made our way through the various papers that
would have to be dealt with next day, the gate
swung open and the postman placed a budget of
letters in my hand.</p>

<p>'Hullo!' I exclaimed, 'an English mail!' And,
excusing myself from the business on hand, I lost
myself in the letters from Home.</p>

<p>I noticed that, when we returned to the agenda
paper and reports, John did not seem as keen as
usual. He went through the documents mechanically,
languidly, perfunctorily, allowing several
matters to pass that, ordinarily, he would have
questioned. He gave me the impression of having
something on his mind, and it was not until we
all sat round the tea-table that I grasped the situation.
Then he opened his heart to us.</p>

<p>'I am very sorry,' he said, 'but if you'll let me,
I think I had better return to Silverstream this
evening after all. The arrival of the English mail
makes all the difference. You have your letters;
mine are waiting for me at the Manse. When I
last heard from Home, my mother was very ill; I
have spent an anxious month waiting for the letter
that has evidently arrived to-day; and I do not feel
that I can settle down to to-morrow's business until
I have seen it.'
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span></p>

<p>The announcement was greeted with demonstrations
of general disappointment. John was a
universal favorite; he was the nearest approach to
a relative that the children had ever known; and
the prospect of having him in the house until bedtime,
and of finding him still on the premises when
they awoke in the morning, had occasioned the
wildest excitement. And now the beautiful dream
was about to be shattered!</p>

<p>'I tell you what, John,' I said, going to the
window and looking out, 'it's going to be a perfect
moonlight night. Spend an hour with the children
after tea, and then I'll drive over to Silverstream
with you. If all's well, we can return together. If
not, we shall understand.'</p>

<p>When, after a sharp cold drive in the moonlight,
we reached the Silverstream Manse, things took an
unexpected turn.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Broadbanks has gone out,' the maid
explained. 'The English mail arrived this afternoon
and she said you would be anxious to get your
Home letter. She took it with her and said that
she would try to get it posted this evening so that
you would get it first thing in the morning. And
I think she intended to look in at Mrs. Blackie's
before she returned and inquire about Alec's broken
leg. I know she took some jellies with her.'</p>

<p>It was now John's turn to be disappointed. He
had had his journey for nothing; indeed, as things
now stood he would be nearer to the letter at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
Mosgiel than at Silverstream. Then an idea occurred to
him.</p>

<p>'Did Mrs. Broadbanks get letters from <span class='it'>her</span> home?'
The maid thought that she did. She knew, at least,
that, after the arrival of the mail, her mistress had
spent some time in the bedroom by herself. John
hurried to the bedroom.</p>

<p>'Hurrah!' he cried, a moment later. 'Here's the
envelope! It is addressed in my mother's handwriting,
and the postmark shows that it left England
on March 16. The last letter left on February 17
and the envelope was addressed by my sister. So
all's serene! Let's get back to Mosgiel!' John wrote
a hurried note for Lilian; left it on the bed; and, in
a few minutes, we were once more startling the
rabbits on the road.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how often the envelope tells us
all that we wish to know. I always feel sorry for
the Postmaster-General. No man on the planet is
under so great an illusion as is he. I can never read
his annual report without amusement. It is a stirring
romance; but the romance is, to some extent,
the romance of <span class='it'>fiction</span> rather than the romance of
<span class='it'>fact</span>. I know that it is a thankless task to rob a
man of an illusion that makes him happy; but the
interests of truth sometimes demand it. They do
in this case. For it is not the Postmaster-General
alone who has been tricked by the witchery of
appearances; the fallacy is shared by all the members
of his enormous staff. Every individual in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
the department, from the Minister down to the messenger-boy,
is equally deceived. The annual report
proves it. For, in this annual report, the Postmaster-General
tells you how many millions of letters
he and his subordinates have handled during the
year. But have they? As a matter of fact, they
have handled no letters at all—except dead letters,
and dead things don't count. The Postmaster-General
handles envelopes; that is all. Let him correct
the statement in his next report.</p>

<p>It will involve him in no loss of prestige, for, as
these three envelopes in the basket plead so plaintively,
and as John Broadbanks discovered that
moonlight night at Silverstream, envelopes have a
significance of their own. The postman knows that.
He never sees the <span class='it'>letters</span>; but the <span class='it'>envelopes</span> whisper
to him a thousand secrets. He knows the envelopes
that contain circulars, and he hands them to you
with a look that is a kind of apology for having
troubled you to answer the door. He knows the
official envelopes that contain demands for rates,
income taxes, and the like. If you are in his good
books, he hands them to you sympathetically; if not,
he secretly enjoys the fun. Here is an envelope
marked 'Urgent'; here is one with a deep black
border; here is one with silver edges! He cannot
be quite deaf to all that these envelopes say. And
here is one, addressed very neatly, to a young lady
at the house at the corner. He brings an exactly
similar envelope to the same fair recipient every
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
other morning. On the morning on which he
brings the envelope, she invariably scampers along
the hall in order personally to receive the letters;
on the alternate mornings her father or her sister
usually respond to his ring. He never sees her letters;
but he knows, he knows! The envelopes chatter
to him all the way down the street. Envelopes
are great gossips. They talk to the sorter; they talk
to the collector; they talk to the postman; they talk
to the receiver; and they even go on talking—like
the trio that set me scribbling—after they have been
tossed disdainfully into the waste-paper basket.</p>

<p>The letter may be interesting in its way; but the
envelope reveals the essential things. When a man
writes to me, he does not tell me what kind of a
man he is; but, recognizing that it is of the utmost
importance to me that this information should be
placed at my disposal, he is good enough to impart
it on the envelope. He smothers the envelope with
hieroglyphs and signs which are more revealing than
a photograph. It frequently happens that my reply
is determined more by these signs than by anything
that he says in the letter. The letter is probably
stiff, formal, lifeless—like a tailor's model. But
the envelope reveals individuality, character, life!
The envelope's the thing! You find all sorts of
things in envelopes; you never find any mock modesty
there. Envelopes are never shy; they never
stand on ceremony; they wait for no introduction;
they begin to talk as soon as they arrive. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
envelope tells me, by means of its postmark, of the
locality from which it has come and of the length
of time that it has spent upon the road. Then,
swiftly establishing itself on friendly terms, it
becomes personal, communicative, confidential. It
tells me that the writer of the letter that I am about
to read is a tidy man or a slovenly man, as the case
may be. Sometimes an envelope will tell me that it
was addressed by a feverish, impulsive, excitable
man; another will assure me, proudly, that it was
sent to me by a leisurely, composed, methodical man.
'I come,' boasts one envelope, 'from a painstaking
and accurate man who is scrupulously careful to
cross every "<span class='it'>t</span>" and dot every "<span class='it'>i</span>."' 'And I,' murmurs
the envelope lying against it, 'come from a
man who doesn't care a rap whether the "<span class='it'>i's</span>" have
dots, or, for that matter, whether the dots have
"<span class='it'>i's</span>"!' Here is an envelope that tells me that it
has been sent to me by a very dilatory man! The
letter is dated March 2; the postmark is dated March
6; he was four days in posting it! This envelope
contains a letter earnestly requesting me to oblige
the writer by speaking at a meeting which he is
organizing, and he is kind enough to speak of the
great value which he attaches to my services. But
the good man has not the heart to deceive me. So,
lest I should take the contents of the letter seriously,
he tells me that he has not even troubled to find
out how I spell my name or what initials I am
pleased to bear. I recognize, of course, that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
information imparted by the envelope is not to be
implicitly trusted. A notorious gossip must always
be heard with the greatest caution. But most people
with much experience of correspondence, before
answering a letter, like to hear what the envelope
has to say about it.</p>

<p>Nature, I notice, is very careful about the envelopes
in which she sends us her letters. The
architecture of an orange is a marvel of symmetry
and compactness; but who has not admired the
color and formation of the peel? Is there anything
on earth more delicate and ingenious than the wrappings
of a maize-cob? The husks and rinds and
pods and shells that we toss upon the rubbish-heap
are masterpieces of design and execution. As a
small boy, I found among my treasures three things
that filled me with ceaseless wonder and admiration—the
skin of horse-chestnuts, the cocoons of my
silkworms and the shells of the birds' eggs that I
brought home from the lane. I knew little about
Nature in those days; but I instinctively based my
first impressions on the envelopes that she sent; and,
judging her by that sure standard, I felt that she
must be wonderfully wise and good and beautiful.</p>

<p>It is considered correct, I understand, to say
that one should not judge by outward appearances;
but how can you help it? Envelopes will talk! I
can never forget a tremendous impression made
upon my mind a few weeks after I went to live in
London. I was barely seventeen. I was feeling
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
horribly lonely, and, on all sorts of subjects, I was
desperately groping my way. One wet night, in
passing down the Strand, I saw hundreds of people
crowding into Exeter Hall. Moved by a sudden
impulse, I followed. The adventure promised a new
experience, and I was specializing in novelties. Then
came the impression! It was not created by the
arguments of the speakers, for, as yet, not one of
them had spoken. It was created by their personal
appearance. The chair was occupied by Sir Stevenson
Arthur Blackwood—'Beauty Blackwood,' as he
was called—and addresses were delivered by the
Revs. Newman Hall, Donald Fraser, Marcus Rainsford
and Archibald G. Brown. I could imagine
nothing more picturesque than those five knightly
figures—tall, dignified and stately. The spectacle
completely captivated me. I gazed spellbound.
While the great audience sang the opening hymn,
my eyes roved from one handsome form to another,
bestowing upon each the silent homage of boyish
hero-worship. This happened more than thirty
years ago; yet I am confident that I could easily
write out a full and accurate report of each of the
speeches delivered that night. So favorably had the
envelopes impressed my mind! And so effectively
had they prepared me for the letters they contained!</p>

<p>In every department of life it is the envelope that
becomes emphatic. In describing at night the people
with whom we have met during the day, we refer
to 'the lady in the fur coat,' 'the girl in the red
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
hat,' and 'the man in the grey suit.' The lady, the
girl and the man—these are letters. The fur coat,
the red hat and the grey suit are merely envelopes.
Yet we feel that to speak of 'a lady,' 'a girl' or 'a
man' is, in effect, to say nothing. It conveys no concrete
idea. It lacks vividness, force, reality. But
'a lady <span class='it'>in a fur coat</span>,' 'a girl <span class='it'>in a red hat</span>,' 'a man
<span class='it'>in a grey suit</span>'—these are pictures! The envelope
makes all the difference.</p>

<p>We often say by way of the envelope what we
cannot say so well in the body of the letter. Charles
Dickens knew that; so did John Bunyan; so did the
Greatest Master of all.</p>

<p>Dickens knew it. Indeed, somebody has as good
as said that Dickens is all envelopes; he gives us
the barrister's wig in mistake for the barrister, the
beadle's cocked hat in mistake for the beadle, and
so on. But if it is true, on the one hand, that Dickens
is too fond of envelopes, it must be confessed,
on the other, that he knows how to use them. Who
can forget the night when David Copperfield and
Mr. Peggotty set out together on one of those dreadful
journeys that stood connected with the loss of
little Emily? Before starting, Mr. Peggotty entered
Emily's room. 'Without appearing to notice what
he was doing,' said David Copperfield, 'I saw how
carefully he adjusted the little room and finally
took out of a drawer one of her dresses, neatly
folded, and placed it on a chair. He made no allusion
to these clothes, neither did I. There they
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
had been waiting for her, many and many a night,
no doubt.' Mr. Peggotty could not express in so
many words all that he felt; but Emily, if she came,
would see the dress lying ready for her, and would
understand that everything was to be just as it
always was. She would see the envelope; and the
envelope would say more than any letter could possibly
do.</p>

<p>Bunyan knew it. The first thing that impressed
the people of Vanity Fair, as they gazed upon
Christian and Faithful, was that 'the pilgrims were
clothed with such kind of raiment as was diverse
from the raiment of any that traded in that fair.'</p>

<p>And Jesus knew it. The most searching and
terrible of all His parables was the parable of the
man who, seated at the king's feast, had not a wedding
garment. And, even more notably, when the
prodigal came home, the father knew of <span class='it'>no
words</span> in which he could adequately welcome his
son. But, if he could not write a satisfactory letter,
he could at least express himself by means of the
envelope! Away with the rags! On with the robes!
Bring forth <span class='it'>the best robe</span> and put it on him, and
put <span class='it'>a ring</span> on his hand and <span class='it'>shoes</span> on his feet!</p>

<p>And even when the Bible attempts to depict the
felicities of the world to come, it does it, not in
the phraseology that we employ in letters, but in the
symbolism that we employ in the use of envelopes.
It speaks of robes and palms and crowns, for it
knows that the wise will understand.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>II—'WHISTLING JIGS TO MILESTONES'</h1>

<h2>I</h2>

<p>Blueberry Creek! Blueberry Creek! Where in
the world was Blueberry Creek? It was all very
well for Conference to resolve—in the easy and
airy fashion that is so charmingly characteristic
of Conferences—that John Broadbanks and I
should be appointed '<span class='it'>to visit and report upon the
affairs of the congregation at Blueberry Creek</span>';
but how on earth were we to get there? On that
point, the Conference, in its wisdom, had given no
directions: it had not even condescended to take so
mundane a detail into its consideration. A fearful
and wonderful thing is a Conference. A Conference
is capable of ordering an inquiry into the state
of the inhabitants of Mars; and it would appoint
its commissioners without giving a thought to the
ways and means by which they were to proceed to
the scene of their investigations. It was altogether
beneath the dignity of that august body to reflect
that Blueberry Creek is as near to the Other End
of Nowhere as any man need wish to go; that it is
many miles from a railway station or a decent road;
and that the only approach to it is by means of a
grassy track that, winding in and out among the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
great brown hills, is, during a large part of the year,
impassable. The only indication of the track's existence
consisted of a suspicion of wheelmarks among
the tussock.</p>

<p>When, at the close of the session, we met on
the steps outside the hall, John and I stared at each
other in a lugubrious bewilderment. Then, seeing,
as he never failed to do, the humor of the situation,
he burst into peals of laughter.</p>

<p>'Blueberry Creek!' he roared, as though the very
name were a joke, 'and how are we to get to Blueberry
Creek?'</p>

<p>Still, while we admired the complacent audacity
with which the Conference had saddled us with the
responsibility of finding—or making—a road to
Blueberry Creek, <span class='it'>we</span> felt, as <span class='it'>it</span> felt, that somebody
ought to go. Allan Gillespie, a young minister, who,
for seven years, had done excellent work there, had
resigned without any apparent reason. The people,
whose confidence, esteem and affection he had completely
won, were depressed and disheartened; and
the work stood in imminent peril. John used to
say that, if you leave a problem long enough, it
will solve itself. The way in which the problem
of getting to Blueberry Creek solved itself certainly
seemed to vindicate his philosophy.</p>

<p>'I've been making inquiries,' said Mr. Alexander
Mitchell, a man of few words but of great practical
sagacity, as he met me in the porch on the last day
of the Conference. 'I've been making inquiries
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
about that appointment of yours. I find that a
motor has been through to Blueberry. If <span class='it'>one</span> can
do it, <span class='it'>another</span> can. I have a sturdy little car that
will get there if it is possible for four wheels to do
it. My business will take me as far as Crannington
next week, so that I shall then be two-thirds of the
way to Blueberry. If you and Mr. Broadbanks care
to accompany me, we will do our best to get through.
I expect we shall have a rough passage, but I am
willing to take all the risks if you are.'</p>

<p>Truth to tell, the project was very much to our
taste. In order that we might make an early start
on the Tuesday, we arranged that John should spend
Monday night as our guest at Mosgiel. He came,
and we both awoke next morning on the best of
terms with ourselves. Civilization was quickly left
behind. We followed the road as far as Crannington;
had lunch there; and then plunged into the
hills. For the next few hours Mr. Mitchell's motor—whose
sturdiness he had by no means exaggerated—was
crashing its way through scrub and
fern; clambering over rocky boulders; gliding down
precipitous gradients; edging its course along
shelves cut in the hillside; and splashing through the
stream whose tortuous folds awaited us in every
hollow. At about five o'clock we emerged upon a
great plain covered with tussock; we made out a
cluster of cottages in the distance; and we knew
that, at last, we had come to Blueberry Creek.</p>

<p>'Why, here is Allan!' exclaimed John, as he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
pointed to a solitary horseman who, dashing along
a track that intersected ours, was evidently hurrying
to join us.</p>

<p>We were soon at the manse. Allan was not
married; his mother kept house for him. 'My
father died of consumption,' he used to say, 'and so
did my grandfather: I must make sure that I am
a <span class='it'>citizen</span> of this planet, and not merely a <span class='it'>visitor</span>,
before I let any pretty girl make eyes at me!'</p>

<p>Our mission was quite unavailing. John and I
had a long talk with Allan after tea.</p>

<p>'No,' he said at last, rising from his chair and
pacing the room under the stress of strong emotion.
His shock of fair wavy hair fell about his forehead
when he was excited, and he brushed it back
impatiently with his hand. His pale blue eyes
burned at such times as though a fire were blazing
behind them. 'No; I feel that I am <span class='it'>whistling jigs
to milestones</span>! I am preaching to people, who,
while they are very good to me, make no response
of any kind to my message. They see to it that
Mother and I want for nothing; they bring us all
kinds of little dainties from the farms and stations;
they share with us whatever's going as the seasons
come around; and they welcome me into their homes
as though I really belonged to them. They are great
church people, too; they attend the services magnificently,
although they have to come long distances
along bad roads in all sorts of weather. They even
compliment me on my sermons, just as a sleeper,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
roused at midnight by the alarm of fire, might, without
rising, praise the dramatic ability of the friend
who had awakened him. I've stood it as long as I
can,' he cried, his lip quivering and his face pale
with passion, 'and now I must give it up. You
needn't try to find me another church; I have no
wish to repeat the experience. I shall preach my
last sermon on Sunday week, and I have chosen my
theme. I shall preach,' he said, coming right up
to us and transfixing us with eyes whose glowing
fervor seemed to scorch us, 'I shall preach on the
<span class='it'>Unpardonable Sin</span>! I shall preach as gently and
as persuasively, but as powerfully, as I know how.
But <span class='it'>that</span> will be my subject. For the Unpardonable
Sin is to tamper with your oracle, to be disloyal to
your vision, to play fast and loose with the truth!'</p>

<p>Allan had an appointment that evening. Mr.
Mitchell, exhausted by his long drive, retired early.
John and I excused ourselves and set off for a walk
across the plain. For a while we journeyed in
silence, enjoying the sunset, the song of the birds
and the evening air. Allan's words, too, had taken
a strong hold upon us.</p>

<p>'There's a lot in what he says,' John remarked
at length, 'especially in his exposition of the Unpardonable
Sin. Strangely enough, I was looking into
the subject only a few days ago. The popular interpretation
is, of course, absurd upon the face of it.
You remember George Borrow's story of Peter
Williams. Peter, as a boy of seven, came upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
passage 'about the Unpardonable Sin and took it
into his head that he could dispose of religion for
the rest of his life by the simple process of committing
that deadly transgression. Arising from his
bed one night, he went out into the open air, had
a good look at the stars, and then, stretching himself
upon the ground and supporting his face with
his hands, the little idiot poured out such a hideous
torrent of blasphemy as, he believed, would destroy
his soul for ever. For years the memory of that
solemn act of spiritual self-destruction darkened all
his days and haunted all his nights. He tormented
himself, as Bunyan did, with the conviction that he
had committed the sin for which there is no forgiveness.
It ended as it did with Bunyan, and as it
always does. Chrysostom says that it is notorious
that men who imagine that they have committed the
sin against the Holy Ghost invariably become Christians
and lead exemplary lives.'</p>

<p>We came at that moment to the banks of the
creek; the waters were sparkling in the moonlight;
we instinctively seated ourselves among the ferns.</p>

<p>'Allan's interpretation,' John went on, 'is much
nearer the mark. The words were addressed in the
first instance to men who declared that Christ cast
out devils by the prince of the devils. The thing
is ridiculous; it is a contradiction in terms. Why
should the prince of the devils occupy himself with
casting out devils? The men who said such a thing
were simply talking for the sake of talking. They
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
were putting no brain into it. They were stultifying
reason; and the man who stultifies his reason is
darkening his own windows. He is, as Allan put
it, tampering with his oracle; he is playing fast and
loose with the truth. A fellow may behave in the
same way towards his conscience or towards any
other means of moral or spiritual illumination. As
soon as he does that kind of thing, he shuts the door
in his own face; he puts himself beyond the possibility
of salvation. And, when I was dipping into
the matter at Silverstream a few nights since, I
came to the conclusion that the passage about the
Unpardonable Sin simply means this: the men who,
in the old Galilean days, distorted the evidence of
the miracles and rejected the testimony of the Son
of Man, were guilty of a serious offence; but it was
a venial offence: for, after all, it was not easy to
realize that a Nazarene peasant was the Son of
God. But those to whom the fullness of the Gospel
has come, and upon whom the light of the ages has
shone, how shall they be made the recipients of the
divine grace if they deliberately block every channel
by which that grace may approach them? If
they stultify their reasons and harden their hearts;
if, as Allan says, they tamper with their oracles and
play fast and loose with the truth, what hope is
there for them? I am sorry to see poor old Allan
taking the apathy of his congregation so much to
heart: but most of us would make better ministers
if we took it to heart a little more.'
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span></p>

<p>We discussed the matter for an hour or so, our
conversation punctuated by the splashing of the
trout in the creek; and then, feeling that it was
getting chilly, we rose and walked back to the manse.
Allan, to our surprise, was already there.</p>

<p>'Now, look,' he said, as he seated himself in his
armchair, and began to poke the fire, 'you two men
have come up here to talk me out of my decision;
and I'm delighted to see you. But tell me this.
A few years ago nobody could talk about the things
of which I speak every Sunday without moving
people to deep emotion. I have been reading the
records of Wesley and Whitefield and Spurgeon.
Why, bless me, it was nothing for those men to see a
whole audience bathed in tears. Whitefield would
have the Kingswood miners crying like babies.
Why do I never see any evidence of deep feeling?
that's what I want to know. You may say that it's
because I don't preach as Wesley and Whitefield
and Spurgeon preached. I thought until lately that
<span class='it'>that</span> was the explanation. But I've given up that
theory: it won't work. Livingstone has a story
about old Baba, a native chief, who bore the most
excruciating torture without the flicker of an eyelid
or the contraction of a muscle. Yet, when Livingstone
read to him the story of the crucifixion, he was
melted to tears. No flights of rhetoric, mark you!
Just the reading of the New Testament, without
note or comment! Now I've read that same story
to my people; and who was much affected by it?
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
Then look at Spurgeon! Why, Spurgeon, anxious
to test the acoustic properties of his new Tabernacle,
entered the pulpit, believing the building to
be empty, and exclaimed, '<span class='it'>Behold the Lamb of God
that taketh away the sin of the world!</span>' A workman,
concealed among the empty pews, heard the words,
listened, heard them repeated, and was profoundly
stirred by them. He laid down his tools, sought an
interview with Spurgeon, and was led into a life of
useful and happy service. No sermon, mark you;
just a text! Why, <span class='it'>I've</span> quoted that same text scores
of times, and who came to <span class='it'>me</span> enquiring the way of
salvation? I shall say all this in my farewell sermon.
I shall say it as kindly as I can, for the
people have been wonderfully good to me; but it
is my duty to say it. And I'm going to recite a few
verses of poetry. Would you like to hear them?
I haven't memorized them yet. I only came upon
them yesterday.'</p>

<p>He slipped off to another room and returned with
a volume of poems by Ella Wheeler Wilcox. Opening
it, he read to us some verses entitled <span class='it'>The Two
Sunsets</span>. They tell how a young fellow, of pure
heart and simple ways, saw a sunset and heard a
song. As the sinking sun filled the western sky
with crimson and gold—</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>He looked, and as he looked, the sight,</p>
<p class='line2'>Sent from his soul through breast and brain</p>
<p class='line2'>Such intense joy, it hurt like pain.</p>
<p class='line0'>His heart seemed bursting with delight.</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>So near the unknown seemed, so close</p>
<p class='line2'>He might have grasped it with his hand.</p>
<p class='line2'>He felt his inmost soul expand,</p>
<p class='line0'>As sunlight will expand a rose.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>And after the story of the sunset we have the
story of the song:</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>One day he heard a singing strain—</p>
<p class='line2'>A human voice, in bird-like trills,</p>
<p class='line2'>He paused, and little rapture-rills</p>
<p class='line0'>Went trickling downward through each vein.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>And then the years went by. Queen Folly held
her sway. She fed his flesh and drugged his mind;
he trailed his glory in the mire. And, after a long
interval, he revisited his boyhood's home, beheld
another sunset and heard another song:</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>The clouds made day a gorgeous bed;</p>
<p class='line2'>He saw the splendor of the sky</p>
<p class='line2'>With <span class='it'>unmoved heart</span> and <span class='it'>stolid eye</span>;</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>He only knew the West was red</span>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>Then, suddenly, a fresh young voice</p>
<p class='line2'>Rose, bird-like, from some hidden place;</p>
<p class='line2'>He did not even turn his face,</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>It struck him simply as a noise</span>!</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>He saw the sunset that once filled him with
ecstasy; but he saw it '<span class='it'>with unmoved heart and stolid
eye</span>'! He heard the song that once sounded to him
like the voice of angels, and '<span class='it'>it struck him simply
as a noise</span>!'</p>

<p>'<span class='it'>That's</span> the Unpardonable Sin!' exclaimed Allan,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
gathering fervor as he proceeded. He sprang from
his chair and stood facing us, his back to the fire.
'<span class='it'>That's</span> the Unpardonable Sin! Miss Wilcox as
good as says so. Listen!</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>O! worst of punishments, that brings</p>
<p class='line2'>A blunting of all finer sense,</p>
<p class='line2'>A loss of feelings keen, intense,</p>
<p class='line0'>And dulls us to the higher things.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>O! shape more hideous and more dread,</p>
<p class='line2'>Than Vengeance takes in Creed-taught minds,</p>
<p class='line2'>This certain doom that blunts and blinds,</p>
<p class='line0'>And strikes the holiest feelings dead!</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>This vehement recital brought on a violent fit of
coughing and he left the room. When he returned
we made no attempt to reply to him. We felt that
the case did not lend itself to argument. We fondly
wished that we could have retained him for the
ministry. His burning passion would have glorified
any pulpit. But what could we say?</p>

<p>We were astir early next morning. Mr. Mitchell
was up soon after dawn getting the car ready for
the road. After breakfast, John led us all in family
worship. Very graciously and very feelingly he
committed the young minister to the divine guidance
and care. He specially pleaded that the closing
days of his ministry might be a season in which
rich fruit should be gathered and lasting impressions
made. 'And,' he continued, 'may the tears that
he sheds as he takes farewell of his people soften
his heart towards them and wash from his eyes the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
vision of their indifference. And may he be astonished
in the Great Day at the abundant response
which their hearts have made to the Word that he
has preached among them.' Half an hour later we
were again speeding towards the hills, Allan and
his mother waving to us from the gate.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>Allan was as good as his word; after leaving
Blueberry he never preached again. 'I must have
a rest for a month or two,' he said. 'I saved a
little money at Blueberry, and I can afford to take
life easily for a while and think things over.' The
next that I heard of him was in a letter, which
some years later I received from John Broadbanks.
'Poor old Allan Gillespie has gone,' he told me.
'His lungs went all to pieces after he left Blueberry;
the tonic air of the hills kept him alive up there.
He went to the Mount Stewart Sanatorium; but
it was too late. He died there three weeks later.
I always felt that his fervent spirit made too heavy
a demand upon so frail a frame. His mother was
much touched by the letters she received from
Blueberry. Crowds of young people wrote to say
that they could never forget the things that, in
public and in private, Allan had said to them; they
owed everything, some of them added, to his intense
devoted ministry. It looks as if they were not so
irresponsive as they seemed.'
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span></p>

<p>I suspect that this is usually so. People are
not so adamantine as they like to look. Still, John
and I will always feel that Allan taught us to take
our work a little more seriously. Whenever we
are tempted to lower our ideals, or to settle down
complacently to things as they are, his great eyes—so
full of solicitude and passion—seem to pierce our
very souls and sting us to concern.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>III—THE FRONT-DOOR BELL</h1>

<p>A fearful and wonderful contrivance is a front-door
bell. The wire attached to my front-door bell
is the line of communication between me and the
universe. The universe knows it—and so do I.
The front-door bell is the one thing about a private
dwelling that is public property. If a stranger
walked in at the front gate and began to push or
pull at anything else, I should instantly send for
the police; but if, with all the confidence of proprietorship,
he walks straight to the front-door bell,
and begins to push or pull at <span class='it'>it</span>, I regard the position
as perfectly normal. No man living may enter my
gate in order to inspect the roses, to admire the
view or to stroke the cat. But any one has a perfect
right to walk boldly up the path and ring the
front-door bell. A man may do what he will with
his own; and the bell is <span class='it'>his</span>. It is more his than
mine. It is perfectly true that I ordered the bell
to be put there, and that I paid for it; but it is also
true that I am the only person on the planet to whom
it is of no use at all. A visitor from Mars, seeing
the bellhangers working to my order, might be
pardoned for supposing that I was gratifying in this
way my insatiable passion for music. Not at all.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
In giving the order for the bell, I was actuated by
no selfish motive. The bell at my front door is not
my bell. It is everybody's bell—everybody's, that
is to say, but mine.</p>

<p>That is why such a thrill runs through the house
when the bell rings. It is one of the sensations of
the commonplace. A ring at the front-door bell is
a bolt from the blue, a call from the vast, a message
from out of the infinite. It presents to the imagination
such a boundless range of possibilities. There
are fifteen hundred million people on the planet,
and this may be any one of them. It may be a
hawker with the inevitable cake of soap—a cake
of soap that he, poor man, appears to need so much
more than I do. It may be the telegraph-boy with
some startlingly pleasant or poignantly painful
message. It may be the very man I want to see or
the very man I don't. Or, then again, it may be
'only Sam.' Everybody knows the accents of ineffable
disdain in which it is announced that the
ringer of the bell is simply a member of the family
circle. It may be anybody; that is the point.
When the front-door bell rings, you are prepared
for anything. You feel, as you await the announcement,
that you have suddenly dipped your hand
into the lucky-bag of the universe, and you are in
a flutter of curiosity as to what you are about to
draw. Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor; rich man, poor
man, beggar man, thief; why is the girl so long in
returning from the door? Smiles, frowns, laughter
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
tears; they may any of them come with the
ringing of the front-door bell. When the bell rings,
you are eating your dinner, or reading the paper,
or romping with the children, or chatting easily
beside the fire. The atmosphere is perfectly tranquil;
all the wheels are running smoothly; life is
without a thrill. The bell rings; all eyes are lifted;
each member of the household glances inquiringly
at all the others; is anybody expecting anybody?
We vaguely feel, when the bell rings, that life is
about to enter upon a fresh phase. Whether the
change will be for weal or for woe, for better or
for worse, we cannot tell. We only know that
things are not likely to be quite the same again.
Somebody will come in, or somebody will be called
out, or something fresh will have to be done. The
cards of life are all shuffled and dealt afresh at the
ringing of the front-door bell.</p>

<p>But it was not of my own bell that I set out to
write. My own bell is not my own bell; why, then,
should I write of it? I prefer to write of the bells
that <span class='it'>do</span> belong to me. The next-door bell is my
bell; and the bell of the house beyond that; and so
on to the end of space. For, if it is humiliating to
reflect that the bell at my own door is not mine,
it is extremely gratifying to be reminded that,
beyond my door, there are millions and millions of
bells that I can proudly call my own. I am not
generally considered musical; but I spend a good
deal of my time in bell-ringing. And I propose to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
describe one or two instruments on which, at some
time or other, I have performed.</p>

<h2>I</h2>

<p>To begin with, there is <span class='it'>the bell that is not working</span>.
To all outward appearance, the mechanism
may be complete. You press the neat little button
and then airily turn your back upon it, happy in the
conviction that you have sent a delicious flutter
through every soul on the premises. In point of
fact you have done nothing of the kind. Things
within are going on just as they were when you
opened the gate; nobody has the slightest suspicion
that you are cooling your heels on the doormat. The
electric battery is exhausted. Beyond a scarcely
perceptible click when your fingers pressed the button,
you made no noise at all. That is the worst
of life's most tragic collapses. There is nothing to
indicate the break-down. The failure does not
advertise itself. 'Samson said, I will go out as at
other times and shake myself; and <span class='it'>he wist not that
the Lord was departed from him</span>.' The button and
the bell were there; how was he to know that the
current had vanished? The preacher enters his
pulpit as of old; who could have suspected that the
invisible force, without which everything is so pitifully
ineffective, had forsaken him. The worker is
still in his place; who would have dreamed that,
having lost his old power, his influence now counts
for so little? Lots of people fancy that a button
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
and a bell complete the requisites of life. Because
the external appliances are in good order, they take
it for granted that everything is working satisfactorily.
It is a woeful blunder. The button may be
there; and the bell may be there; yet the entire outfit
may be destitute of all practical utility. I called
at a house last week. Outside there was a button
and inside there was a bell. I pressed the button
several times and only discovered afterwards that
the mechanism to which it was attached gave the
lady of the house no intimation of my presence at
her door. The bell was not working.</p>

<p>A bell that is out of action represents a broken
line of communication between the individual and
the universe. Some time ago my bell broke down.
I heard every day of people who had called and
gone away, fancying that nobody was at home.
I wondered every night what I had missed during
the day through being out of touch with the world.
The broken bell had turned me into a hermit, an
exile, a recluse. People might want me never so
badly; they could not get at me. I might want
them never so badly; they left the door without my
seeing them.</p>

<p>The saddest case of this kind that ever came
under my notice occurred at Hobart. A gentleman
called one day and made it clear that his business
was marked by gravity and urgency.</p>

<p>'My name,' he said, 'is McArthur. My mother
is lying very ill at the Homeopathic Hospital. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
would be a great comfort to us all, and to her, if
you could run up and see her. She has often asked
us to send for you; but we have always put it off.
It seemed like encouraging her in the notion that
her days were few. But now we shall be very glad
if you will go. I ought to tell you, though, that
my mother is very deaf. You will not be able to
make her hear. But you will find a slate and pencil
at the bedside. If you write on it whatever you
wish to say, she will be able to read it and reply
to you.'</p>

<p>I went at once. When I told the matron that I
had come to see Mrs. McArthur, a strange look overspread
her face and she drew me into her private
room.</p>

<p>'Is she dead?' I asked, 'or unconscious?'</p>

<p>'Oh, no,' the matron replied, 'she is alive and
quite conscious. But during the last few hours
her sight has failed her. She can only see us like
shadows between herself and the window. I don't
know how you will be able to communicate with
her.'</p>

<p>I never felt so helpless in my life. As I stood
by her bedside she seemed so near, yet so very
far away. I stroked her forehead and she smiled;
but that was all. I was standing on the doormat
pressing the button; but the bell was not working.
I could not establish communication with the soul
within. It is a way that bells have. The current
becomes exhausted sooner or later. It is clearly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
intended that, while we are in touch with the
universe, we should learn all that the universe can
teach us, so that, when the line of communication
collapses, we shall be independent of the universe
and need its messages no more.</p>

<p>Then there is <span class='it'>the bell that, when I press the button,
rings without my hearing it</span>. One day last
week I called at a house in Winchester Avenue. I
pressed the button several times, listening intently.
I could hear no sound within. I tapped; but still
everything was silent. I was just stooping to slip
my card under the door when, suddenly, I heard a
rush and a commotion within, and in a moment,
Mrs. Finch, full of charming apologies, stood before
me. She had heard the bell each time; but her
maid was out; she was herself completing her toilet;
she was dreadfully ashamed to have kept me
waiting.</p>

<p>We are too apt to suppose that our pressure of
the button is awakening no response. We fancy
that our words fall upon deaf ears. People appear
to take no notice. Perhaps, if we knew all, we
should discover that while we press, and listen, and
hear nothing, we are all unconsciously throwing
some gentle spirit into a perfect fever of agitation.</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>I pressed the button at my neighbor's door;</p>
<p class='line0'>But, when I heard no sound, I turned and stood</p>
<p class='line0'>Irresolute. If I had moved a bell</p>
<p class='line0'>I must have heard it. Should I rap, or go?</p>
<p class='line0'>But in a moment more my neighbor came.</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>'The bell is far, and very small,' he said.</p>
<p class='line0'>'You may not catch it for the walls between</p>
<p class='line0'>But rest assured, each time you push the knob</p>
<p class='line0'>We cannot choose but hear the bell inside.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>And what they told me of my neighbor's bell</p>
<p class='line0'>Has cheered me when I knocked at some hard heart</p>
<p class='line0'>And caught no answer. Now and then</p>
<p class='line0'>I poured my soul out in a hot appeal</p>
<p class='line0'>And had no sign from lip, or hand, or eye,</p>
<p class='line0'>That he I would have saved had even heard.</p>
<p class='line0'>And I have sighed and turned away; and then</p>
<p class='line0'>My neighbor's words came back: 'We cannot choose</p>
<p class='line0'>But hear inside.'</p>
<p class='line18'>And after many days</p>
<p class='line0'>I have had an answer to a word I spoke</p>
<p class='line0'>In ears that seemed as deaf as dead men's ears.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>I was twelve years at Mosgiel in New Zealand.
I always felt that the men and women, and especially
the old people, were attached to me; but, somehow,
I was never as successful with the children as I
should like to have been. I was very fond of them;
I loved to meet them, play with them, talk with
them; but I saw them grow up to be young men
and women without being impressed in any way
by any word of mine. That was the bitterest ingredient
in my sorrow when, fifteen years ago, I
left that little country town.</p>

<p>During the past three years I have traveled
Australia from end to end. In a railway journey
of seven thousand miles I have crossed and recrossed
the entire continent. And one of the most delightful
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
experiences of this great trip was to meet my
old Mosgiel boys and girls at every turn. One girl
came, with her husband, a hundred miles to spend
five minutes with me at the railway station; others
traveled with me for twenty or thirty miles just
for the sake of the talk in the train. Without an
exception, they were all well and happy and living
useful lives. In every case they reminded me of
things that I had said and done in the old days—things
that, as I fancied, had made no impression
at all. And when I returned to the quiet of my
own home, and reviewed all these happy reunions,
I felt ashamed of having suspected these young
people of being irresponsive. The bell often rings
without <span class='it'>our</span> hearing it.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>On the other hand, it does occasionally happen
that, when I press the button, the bell rings; I
myself, standing on the doormat, distinctly hear
it; <span class='it'>yet it is not heard by those upon whom I have
called</span>.</p>

<p>'I am so sorry,' exclaimed Mrs. Wilson, as she
left the church last evening. 'I took my book on
Thursday afternoon and strolled down to the summer-house
at the foot of the garden; I must have
become absorbed in the story; I did not hear the
bell; and, when I came in, I found your card under
the door.'</p>

<p>'I say,' cried Harry Blair, 'I am awfully sorry.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
I must have been at home when you called. But
the bell is at the front of the house, and we happened
to be at the back. The children were making such
a din that we never heard you.'</p>

<p>Precisely! There are those whose bells we ring
in vain. In the days in which I made up my mind
to be a minister, I fell under the influence of the
Rev. James Douglas, M.A., of Brixton, a most
devout and scholarly man. He often took me for
a walk on Clapham Common, and said things to me
that I have never forgotten.</p>

<p>'When you are a minister,' he said one day, as
we sat under the shelter of a giant oak, 'when you
are a minister, you will find, wherever you go, that
there are a certain number of people whom you are
not fitted to influence. It is largely a matter of
personality and temperament. Don't break your
heart over it. Satisfy your conscience that you
have done your duty by them, and then leave it at
that!'</p>

<p>It was wise counsel. There are a certain number
of bells that, rung by us, are not heard within.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p>And, last and saddest of all, there is <span class='it'>the bell that
we did not ring</span>. We half thought of it; we heard
afterwards how welcome a call would have been;
but the contemplated visit was not paid.</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>Around the corner I have a friend,</p>
<p class='line0'>In the great city that has no end.</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet days go by and weeks rush on,</p>
<p class='line0'>And before I know it a year is gone;</p>
<p class='line0'>And I never see my old friend's face,</p>
<p class='line0'>For life is a swift and terrible race.</p>
<p class='line0'>He knows I love him just as well</p>
<p class='line0'>As in the days when I rang his bell</p>
<p class='line0'>And he rang mine. We were younger then,</p>
<p class='line0'>And now we are busy, tired men—</p>
<p class='line0'>Tired with playing a foolish game,</p>
<p class='line0'>Tired with trying to make a name.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>'To-morrow,' I say, 'I will call on Jim,</p>
<p class='line0'>Just to show that I'm thinking of him.'</p>
<p class='line0'>But to-morrow comes and to-morrow goes,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the distance between us grows and grows,</p>
<p class='line0'>Around the corner—yet miles away.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class='line0'>'Here's a telegram, sir.' 'Jim died to-day!'</p>
<p class='line0'>And that's what we get and deserve in the end—</p>
<p class='line0'>Around the corner a vanished friend.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>I really intended to have pressed the button at
Jim's door; but the good intentions did not ring the
bell; and I am left to nurse my lifelong remorse.</p>

<p>I really intended to have answered the door when
a Visitor Divine stood gently knocking there; but
the good intention did not let Him in; He turned
sadly and wearily away; and I am left to my shame
and my everlasting regret.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>IV—THE GREEN CHAIR</h1>

<h2>I</h2>

<p>The green chair was never occupied. It stood—according
to Irving Bacheller—in the home of
Michael Hacket; and Michael Hacket is the most
lovable schoolmaster in American literature. Michael
Hacket possessed a violin and a microscope. The
romps that he led with the one, and the researches
that he conducted with the other, represented the
two sides of his character; for he was the jolliest
soul in all that countryside, and the wisest. But,
in addition to the violin and the microscope, Michael
Hacket possessed a green chair; and the green chair
was even more valuable, as a revelation of the
schoolmaster's character, than either the microscope
or the violin. Barton Baynes, the hero of the story,
went as a boarder to Mr. Hacket's school; and the
green chair deeply impressed him. When the family
assembled at table, the green chair, always empty,
was always there. Before he took his own seat,
Mr. Hacket put his hand on the back of the green
chair and exclaimed:</p>

<p>'A merry heart to you, Michael Henry!'</p>

<p>It was a rollicking meal, that first meal at which
Barton was present; the schoolmaster was full of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
quips and jests; and his clever sallies kept everybody
bubbling with laughter. Then, when all had
finished, he rose and took the green chair from the
table, exclaiming:</p>

<p>'Michael Henry, God bless you!'</p>

<p>'I wondered at the meaning of this,' says Barton,
'but I dared not ask.' Shortly afterwards, however,
he summed up courage to do so. Mr. Hacket had
gone out.</p>

<p>'I've been all day in the study,' the schoolmaster
had said; 'I must take a walk or I shall get an
exalted abdomen. One is badly beaten in the race
of life when his abdomen gets ahead of his toes.
Children, keep Barton happy till I come back, and
mind you, don't forget the good fellow in the green
chair!'</p>

<p>He had not been long gone when the children
differed as to the game that they should play. A
dispute was threatening.</p>

<p>'Don't forget Michael Henry!' said Mrs. Hacket,
reprovingly.</p>

<p>'Who <span class='it'>is</span> Michael Henry?' asked Barton.</p>

<p>'Sure,' replied Mrs. Hacket, 'he's the child that
has never been born. He was to be the biggest and
noblest of them all—kind and helpful and cheery-hearted
and beloved of God above all the others.
We try to live up to him.'</p>

<p>'He seemed to me,' said Barton, 'a very strange
and wonderful creature—this invisible occupant of
the green chair. Michael Henry was the spirit of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
their home, an ideal of which the empty chair was
a constant reminder.'</p>

<p>When a conversation threatened to become too
heated, it was always Michael Henry whose ears
must not be offended by harsh and angry tones; it
was Michael Henry who had begged that a culprit
might be forgiven just this once: it was Michael
Henry who was always suggesting little acts of
courtesy and kindness.</p>

<p>'I like to think of Michael Henry,' the schoolmaster
would say. 'His food is good thoughts and
his wine is laughter. I had a long talk with Michael
Henry last night when you were all abed. His face
was a chunk of merriment. Oh, what a limb he is!
I wish I could tell you all the good things he said!'</p>

<p>But he couldn't; and we all know why.</p>

<p>There was no Michael Henry! And yet Michael
Henry—the occupant of the green chair—pervaded
like a perfume and ruled like a prince the gentle
schoolmaster's delightful home!</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>We are very largely ruled by empty chairs. In
support of this contention let me call two or three
witnesses. The first is Clarence Shadbrook.</p>

<p>Clarence was well on in life when I first met
him. He struck me as being reserved, taciturn,
unsociable. It took me several years, I grieve to
say, to understand him. It was on the occasion
of his wife's death that I first caught glimpses of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
unsuspected depths of tenderness and sentiment
within him. Hannah Shadbrook was one of our
most excellent women. She had a kind thought
for everybody. She was the heart and soul of our
ladies' organizations. In every good cause her hand
was promptly outstretched to help. She was especially
tactful in her dealings with the young people:
to many of the girls she was a second mother. She
was tall and spare, with a slight stoop at the shoulders;
her eyes were soft and gray; and her face was
illumined by a look of wonderful intelligence and
sweetness. She was the sort of woman to whom
one could tell anything.</p>

<p>Somehow, I had always imagined that, at home,
she was unappreciated. I cannot recall anything
that I ever heard or saw that can have given me
so false and unfortunate an impression. But there
it was! And it was, therefore, with a shock of surprise
that, at the time of her death, I found the
strong and silent man so utterly broken and
disconsolate.</p>

<p>'Ah,' he sobbed, when, in a few halting words,
I referred to the affection in which his wife was
held at the church, 'I dare say. But it was at home
that she was at her best. Nobody will ever know
what she was to me and to the children who have
married and gone.'</p>

<p>But it was not until two years later that he
opened his heart more thoroughly. I heard on a
certain Sunday evening that he was ill; and next
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
day I made my way to the cottage. He was in
bed. I stepped across to the window and laid my
hand upon a chair, intending to transfer it to the
bedside.</p>

<p>'Excuse me,' he said, 'but don't take that one.
Would you mind having the chair over by the wardrobe
instead?'</p>

<p>If the request struck me as strange, the thought
only lingered for a moment. I replaced the chair
that I was holding; took the one indicated; and dismissed
the matter from my mind.</p>

<p>'I dare say you are wondering why I asked you
not to take the chair by the window,' he said presently,
after we had discussed the weather, the news,
and his prospects of a speedy recovery. 'There's
a story about that chair that I've never told to anybody,
except to her'—glancing at a portrait—'but if
you'd like to hear it, I don't mind telling you.'</p>

<p>'Well,' he went on, assured of my interest, 'I took
a fancy to that chair nearly fifty years ago. I was
learning wood-carving; I thought that it would suit
my purpose: and I bought it. It was the first piece
of furniture that I ever possessed. I remember
laughing to myself as I carried it to my little room.
It stood beside the bed there for a year or two. Then
I met Hannah. At first I felt a little bit afraid of
her. She seemed far too good for me. But then,
I thought to myself, she is far too good for anybody.
And so our courtship began, and one night
I came home tremendously excited. We were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>
engaged! I lay awake for hours that night, sometimes
painting wonderful pictures of the happy days
to be, and sometimes lecturing myself as to the
kind of man I must become in order to be worthy
of the treasure about to be confided to my care. And
I comforted myself with the reminder that I should
have her always beside me to restrain the worst
and encourage the best that was in me. And, thinking
such thoughts, I at length fell asleep. But, sleeping,
I went on dreaming. I thought that, coming
home tired from the shop, I entered my little room
at the top of the stairs (the room in which I was
actually sleeping) and was surprised to find it occupied.
A man was sitting in the chair beside the
bed—the chair over there by the window. But I
could not be angry, for he looked up and welcomed
me with a smile that disarmed my suspicions and
made me feel that all was well. I felt instantly and
powerfully drawn to him. He seemed to magnetize
me. His face realized my ideal of manly strength,
tempered by an indefinable charm and courtesy.
Then, as I gazed, it occurred to me that there was,
about his countenance and bearing, something
strangely familiar. What could it mean? Whom
could it be? And then the truth flashed upon me.
It was <span class='it'>myself</span>! Yes, it was myself as I should be
in the years to come under Hannah's gentle and
gracious influence! It was myself transfigured! I
awoke and found myself staring fixedly at the empty
chair beside the bed—the chair that you were about
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
to remove from the window there. I made up my
mind that day that the chair should never be used.
It is dedicated to the ideal self of whom I caught
a glimpse in my boyish dream. And, even now, the
shadowy visitor of that memorable night seems to
be still sitting there; and I never approach the chair
without mentally comparing myself with its silent
occupant.'</p>

<p>Who would have supposed that, beneath the
rugged exterior of Clarence Shadbrook, there dwelt
so rich a vein of poetry and romance? I almost
apologized to him for my earlier judgment. It only
shows that, like the first Australian explorers, we
may tread the gold beneath our feet without suspecting
its existence.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>My second witness is Harold Glendinning. Harold
was the minister at Port Eyre, a little seaside
town close to the harbor's mouth. He had frequently
asked me to exchange pulpits with him, and at last
he had coaxed me to consent.</p>

<p>'Come early on Saturday,' he wrote, 'so that we
may have an hour or two together here before I
have to leave.'</p>

<p>Like Clarence Shadbrook, Harold was a widower.
But, unlike Clarence, he was still young. His wife
had faded and died after three short years of married
life. His mother kept house for him at the
manse.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span></p>

<p>I reached Port Eyre early on the Saturday. We
went for a walk round the rocky coast before
dinner; and in the afternoon Harold made preparations
for departure.</p>

<p>'But, dear me,' he exclaimed, 'I haven't shown
you your room. Come with me!' And he led me
out into the hall and up the stairs.</p>

<p>The room was obviously his own. Photographs
of his young wife were everywhere. Her presence
pervaded it. The window commanded a noble view
of the bay, and we stood for a minute or two admiring
the prospect. We then turned towards the
door.</p>

<p>'Treat the place as though it belonged to you,'
he said. 'Make yourself perfectly at home. You're
welcome to everything except—' He half-closed
the door again.</p>

<p>'You'll understand, I know,' he went on, 'but
don't use the armchair over there in the corner.'
I glanced in the direction indicated by his gaze.
A comfortable chair stood beside a small occasional
table on which a lovely bowl of roses had been
placed.</p>

<p>'It's <span class='it'>her</span> chair,' he explained. 'It used to stand
by the fireplace in the dining-room. She sat there
every evening, reading or sewing, with her feet resting
on her campstool.' I noticed now that a folded
campstool stood near the chair. 'Somehow,' he
continued, 'the chair seemed to become a part of
her. And after—afterwards—I couldn't bear to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
leave it there for anybody to occupy who happened
to call; so I brought it up here. And, somehow,
with the chair there, she doesn't seem so very far
away. I'll show you something else,' he said; and,
diving into a drawer near his hand, he produced an
old magazine.</p>

<p>'I only found this afterwards,' he explained. 'At
least I only noticed the marked passage. I saw it
in her lap several times during the last week or two,
and, in an off-hand way, I picked it up and glanced
through it. But it was only after—afterwards—that
I noticed that faint pencil-mark beside this
poem.' He handed me the magazine, and, surely
enough, I detected a mark, so faint as to be scarcely
visible, beside some lines by L. C. Jack.</p>

<p>'You may think it strange,' he concluded, as we
turned to leave the room, 'but I often fancy that the

chair in the corner makes it a little more easy for
me to live in the spirit of those lines.'</p>

<p>I had intended calling several other witnesses;
but I must be content with one. Alec Fraser was
a little old Scotsman, who lived about seven miles
out from Mosgiel. I heard one day that he was
very ill, and I drove over to see him. His daughter
answered the door, showed me in, and placed a
chair for me beside the bed. I noticed, on the other
side of the bed, another chair. It stood directly
facing the pillow, as if its occupant had been in
earnest conversation with the patient.</p>

<p>'Ah, Alec,' I exclaimed, on greeting him, 'so I'm
not your first visitor!'</p>

<p>He looked up surprised, and, in explanation, I
glanced at the tell-tale position of the chair.</p>

<p>'Oh,' he said, with a smile, 'I'll tell ye aboot the
chair by-and-by; but how are the wife and the weans
and the kirk?'</p>

<p>I found that he was far too ill, however, to be
wearied by general conversation. I read to him the
Shepherd's Psalm; I led him to the Throne of
Grace; and then I rose to go.</p>

<p>'Aboot the chair,' he said, as I took his hand,
'it's like this. Years ago I found I couldna pray.
I fell asleep on my knees, and, even if I kept awake,
my thochts were aye flittin'. One day, when I was
sair worried aboot it, I spoke to Mr. Clair
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
Mackenzie, the meenister at Broad Point. We hadna
a meenister o' oor ain at Mosgiel then. He was a
guid auld man, was Mr. Mackenzie. And he telt
me not to fash ma heed aboot kneeling down. "Jest
sit ye down," he said, "and pit a chair agen ye for
the Lord, and talk to Him just as though He sat
beside ye!" An' I've been doin' it ever since. So
now ye know what the chair's doin', standing the
way it is!'</p>

<p>I pressed his hand and left him. A week later
his daughter drove up to the manse. I knew everything,
or almost everything, as soon as I saw her
face.</p>

<p>'Father died in the night,' she sobbed. 'I had
no idea that death was so near, and I had just gone
to lie down for an hour or two. He seemed to be
sleeping so comfortably. And, when I went back,
he was gone! He didn't seem to have moved since
I saw him last, except that <span class='it'>his hand was out on the
chair</span>. Do you understand?'</p>

<p>I understood.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>V—LIVING DOGS AND DEAD LIONS</h1>

<h2>I</h2>

<p>Mosgiel was in the throes of an anniversary. As
part of the programme, John Broadbanks and I
were exchanging pulpits. In order to be on the
spot when Sunday arrived, I was driven over to
Silverstream on the Saturday evening. When I
awoke on Sunday morning, and looking out of the
Manse window, found the whole plain buried deep
in snow, I was glad that I had taken this precaution.
At breakfast we speculated on the chances of my
having a congregation. Later on, however, the
buggies began to arrive, and by eleven o'clock
most of the homesteads were represented. But
what about Sunday school in the afternoon? I
told the teachers to feel under no obligation to come.
'I shall be here,' I said, 'and if any of the children
put in an appearance, I shall be pleased to look after
them.' When the afternoon came, there were three
scholars present—Jack Linacre, who had ridden
over on his pony from a farm about two miles away;
Alec Crosby, a High School boy, who lived in a
large house just across the fields; and little Myrtle
Broadbanks—Goldilocks, as we called her—who had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
accompanied me from the Manse. I decided to
return with my three companions to the Manse and
to hold our Sunday school by the fireside.</p>

<p>'Well,' I said, as soon as we were all cosily seated,
'I was reading this morning in the Bible about a
living dog and a dead lion. Which would you
rather be?' There was a pause. Jack was the first
to speak.</p>

<p>'Oh, I'd rather be the living dog,' he blurted
out; 'it's better to be alive than dead any day!'</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't know!' exclaimed Alec. Alec was
a thoughtful boy who had already carried off two
or three scholarships. He had been weighing the
matter carefully while Jack was giving us the
benefit of his first impressions. 'I don't know. A
dead lion has been a living lion, while the living dog
will be a dead dog some day. I think I'd rather be
the dead lion.'</p>

<p>'Well, Goldilocks,' I said, turning to the little
maiden at my side, 'and what do <span class='it'>you</span> think about
it?'</p>

<p>'Oh,' she said, 'I think I'd like a little of both.
I'd like to be <span class='it'>a lion</span> like the one and <span class='it'>alive</span> like the
other!'</p>

<p>This all happened many years ago. Jack Linacre
now owns the farm from which he then rode over;
Alec Crosby is a doctor with a large practice in
Sydney; and I heard of Goldilocks' wedding only
a few weeks ago. I expect they have forgotten all
about the snowy afternoon that we spent by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
fireside at Silverstream; but I smile still as I recall
the answers that they gave to the question that I set
them.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>There is something to be said for Jack's way of
looking at things. Our love of life is our master-passion.
It animates us at every point. It is
because we are in love with life that we see so much
beauty in the dawning of a new day and find so
wealthy a romance in the unfolding of the Spring.
We feel that, among the myriad mysteries of the
universe, there is no mystery so elusive and so
sublime as this one. A living moth is a more wonderful
affair than a dead moon. Indeed, we only
recognize the strength of the hold that life has upon
us when there is some question of its extinction.
Let a man stand on the seashore, and, unable to
help, watch an exhausted swimmer struggle for his
life in the seething waters; let him look up and
follow the movements of a steeplejack as he climbs
a dizzy spire; let him visit a circus and see an artist
hazard his life in the course of some sensational
performance; and, for the moment, he will find his
heart in his mouth. The blood will forsake his face;
he will be filled with trepidation and palpitation; he
can scarcely breathe! And why? The people in
peril are nothing to him. For him, life would go on
in just the same way whether they live or die. Yet
their danger fills him with uncontrollable
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
excitement! Or look, if you will, in quite another
direction.</p>

<p>I was in a tramcar yesterday afternoon. In the
corner opposite was a lad—probably an errand-boy—curled
up with a book. His sparkling eyes were
glued to the pages; his face was flushed with excitement;
he was completely lost to his immediate surroundings.
I rose to leave the car. The movement
evidently aroused him. He glanced out of the
window, and then, with a start, shut the book and
sprang up to follow me.</p>

<p>'Have you passed your proper corner?' I asked
when, side by side, we reached the pavement.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' he said, 'I was reading the book and
never noticed.'</p>

<p>'Exciting, was it?' I inquired, reaching out my
hand for the volume. On the cover was a picture
of a Red Indian galloping across the prairie, with a
white girl thrown across the front of his saddle.</p>

<p>'My word, it was!' he replied. 'It's about a fellow
who was flying for his life from the Indians and
took refuge in a cave. And, when he got back into
the dark part of the cave, he felt something warm
and then heard the growl of a bear. My! I thought
he was dead that time!'</p>

<p>And what did it matter? It was nothing to
this errand-boy whether this hero of his—a mere
frolic of an author's fancy—lived or died. And
yet the life or death of that hero was of such
moment to him that, for the time being, his mind
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
lost its hold upon realities in order that it might
concentrate itself upon a fight among shadows! It
is our intense, our persistent, our unquenchable love
of life that explains the fascination of all tales of
romance and adventure. 'With man as with the
animals,' says Dr. James Martineau, 'death is the evil
from which he himself most shrinks, and which he
most deplores for those he loves; it is the utmost
that he can inflict upon his enemy and the maximum
which the penal justice of society can award
to its criminals. It is the fear of death which gives
their vivid interest to all hairbreadth escapes, in
the shipwreck or amid the glaciers or in the fight;
and it is man's fear of death that supplies the chief
tragic element in all his art.' When we find ourselves
following with breathless interest the movements
of the traveller, the hunter or the explorer,
we fancy that our emotion arises from a solicitude
for the man himself. As a matter of fact, it arises
from nothing of the kind. It arises from our love
of <span class='it'>life-for-its-own-sake</span>.</p>

<p>In his <span class='it'>Lavengro</span>, George Borrow describes an
open-air service which he attended on a large open
moor. The preacher—a tall, thin man in a plain
coat and with a calm, serious face—was urging his
hearers not to love life overmuch and to prepare
themselves for death. 'The service over,' Borrow
says, 'I wandered along the heath till I came to a
place where, beside a thick furze, sat a man, his
eyes fixed intently on the red ball of the setting
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
sun.' It looked like his old comrade, Jasper
Petulengro, the gipsy.</p>

<p>'Is that you, Jasper?'</p>

<p>'Indeed, brother!'</p>

<p>'And what,' enquired the newcomer, sitting by
the gipsy's side, 'what is your opinion of death,
Jasper?'</p>

<p>'Life is sweet, brother!'</p>

<p>'Do you think so?'</p>

<p>'Think so! There's night and day, brother, both
sweet things; sun, moon and stars, brother, all sweet
things; there's likewise a wind on the heath. Life
is very sweet, brother; who would wish to die?'</p>

<p>I need say no more in order to show that there
is a good deal to be said for Jack Linacre's way of
looking at things.</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>How beautiful it is to be alive!</p>
<p class='line2'>To wake each morn as if the Maker's grace</p>
<p class='line0'>Did us afresh from nothingness derive</p>
<p class='line2'>That we might sing 'How happy is our case!</p>
<p class='line0'>How beautiful it is to be alive!'</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>From Jack's point of view there can be no doubt
that one living dog is worth all the dead lions that
ever were or will be!</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>Alec Crosby, however, is not so sure. 'A dead
lion,' he points out, 'has been a living lion, while
the living dog will be a dead dog some day.' There
is something in that. He means, if I rightly catch
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
the drift of his philosophy, that you can pay too
much for the privilege of being alive. Everything
else has its price, and most of us buy our goods on
too high a market. One man pays too much for
popularity; he sells his conscience for it. Another
pays too much for fame; it costs him his health.
A third buys his money too dearly; in gaining the
whole world he loses his own soul. And in the
same way, a man may pay too much even for life
itself. The dog, as Alec Crosby probably knew,
is usually employed in Oriental literature as an
emblem of the contemptible; the dog in our modern
sense—Rover, Carlo and the rest—is unknown.
The lion, on the other hand, is invariably the symbol
of the courageous. Alec thinks that, all things considered,
it is better to be a dead hero than a living
coward. Alec reminds me of Artemus Ward. On
the day of a general election, Artemus entered a
polling-booth and began to look about him in evident
perplexity. The returning officer approached
and offered to help him.</p>

<p>'For whom do you desire to vote?' he asked.</p>

<p>'I want to vote for Henry Clay!' replied Artemus
Ward.</p>

<p>'For Henry Clay!' exclaimed the astounded
officer, 'why, Henry Clay has been dead for years!'</p>

<p>'Yes, I know,' replied Artemus Ward, 'but I'd
rather vote for Henry Clay dead than for either of
these men living!'</p>

<p>Alec Crosby could easily call a great host of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span>
witnesses to support his view of the matter. Let
me summon two—one from martyrology and one
from fiction.</p>

<p>My first witness shall be Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop
of Canterbury. For his fidelity to the truth,
Cranmer was sentenced to die at the stake. But
every day during his imprisonment he was offered
life and liberty if only he would sign the deed of
recantation. Every morning the document was
spread out before him and the pen placed in his
hand. Day after day, he resisted the terrible temptation.
But, as Jasper says, life is very sweet; the
craving to live was too strong; Cranmer yielded.
But, as soon as the horror of a cruel death had been
removed, he felt that he had bought the boon of
life at too high a price. The death with which he
had been threatened was the death of a lion; the
life that he was living was the life of a dog! He
held himself in contempt and abhorrence. He
cowered before the faces of his fellow men! Life
on such terms was intolerable. He made a recantation
of the recantation. As a token of his remorse,
he burned to a cinder the hand with which he signed
the cowardly document. And then, at peace with
his conscience, he embraced a fiery death with a
joyful heart. He felt that it was a thousand times
better to be a dead lion than a living dog.</p>

<p>My witness from fiction is introduced to me by
Maxwell Gray. In <span class='it'>The Silence of Dean Maitland</span>,
he shows that life may be bought at too high a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
price. Cyril Maitland had committed a murder;
yet all the circumstances pointed to the guilt of his
innocent friend, Henry Everard. Maitland felt
every day that it was his duty to confess; but
the lure of life was too strong for him; and, besides,
he was a minister, and his confession would bring
shame upon his sacred office! And so the years
went by. While Everard languished in jail, having
been sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment,
Maitland advanced in popularity and won swift preferment.
He became a dean. But his life was a
torture to him. He felt that death—even the death
that he had dreaded—would have been infinitely
preferable. And, after suffering agonies such as
Everard in prison never knew, he at last made a
clean breast of his guilt and laid down the life for
which he had paid too much. Thomas Cranmer and
Dean Maitland would both take sides with Alec
Crosby.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p>But it was Goldilocks that, on that snowy afternoon
at Silverstream, hit the nail on the head.</p>

<p>'I think I'd like a little of both,' she said. 'I'd
like to be <span class='it'>a lion</span> like the one and <span class='it'>alive</span> like the other!'</p>

<p>Precisely! With her feminine facility for putting
her finger on the very heart of things, Goldilocks has
brushed away all irrelevancies and got to bedrock.
For, after all, the question of life and death does
not really concern us. A dog, living or dead, can
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
be nothing other than a dog; a lion, living or dead,
can be nothing other than a lion. The dead lion,
as Alec Crosby says, was a living lion once; the
living dog will be a dead dog some day. Goldilocks
helps us to clear the issue. The real alternative is
not between life and death; for life and death come
in turn to dog and lion alike. The real question
is between the canine and the leonine. Shall I live
contemptibly or shall I live courageously?</p>

<p>'And I looked,' says the last of the Biblical writers,
'and behold, a lion—<span class='it'>the Lion of the tribe of
Juda</span>!'</p>

<p>Like a lion He lived! With the courage of a lion
He died! And in leonine splendor He moves
through all the world above. Goldilocks had evidently
made up her mind, in life and in death, to
model her character and experience upon His!</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>VI—NEW BROOMS</h1>

<p>New brooms, they say, sweep clean. The statement
is scarcely worth challenging. It is ridiculous
upon the face of it. How can new brooms sweep
clean? New brooms do not sweep at all. If they
sweep, they are not new brooms: they have been
used; the dealer will not receive them back into
stock; they are obviously second-hand. But I need
not stress that point. My antagonism to the ancient
saw rests on other grounds.</p>

<p>New brooms, they say, sweep clean. It is invariably
a cynic who says it. He seizes the proverb
as he would seize a bludgeon; and, with it, he makes
a murderous attack on the first young enthusiast he
happens to meet. It is a barbarous weapon, and can
be wielded by an expert with deadly effects. It is
a thousand times worse than a shillalah, a tomahawk,
a baton, or a club; with either of these a
man can break your head; but with the saying about
the new broom he can break your heart. I well
remember the public meeting at which I was formally
welcomed to Mosgiel. Among the speakers
was an old minister of the severely conservative
type, with whom I subsequently grew very intimate.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
But at that stage, as he himself told me afterwards,
he deeply resented my coming. He regarded it as
an intrusion. He said, in the course of his speech,
that he confidently expected to hear, during the
next few months, the most glowing accounts of the
work at the Mosgiel Church. That, he cruelly
observed, was the usual thing. A young minister's
first year among his people is, he remarked, a year of
<span class='it'>admiration</span>; the second is a year of <span class='it'>toleration</span>;
and the third, a year of <span class='it'>abomination</span>. New brooms,
he said, sweep clean. The jest, I dare say, rolled
from the memories of the people like water from
a duck's back. I doubt if they gave it a second
thought. They probably remarked to one another
as they drove back to their farms that the old
gentleman was in a droll humor. But, to me, his
words were like the thrust of a sword; he stabbed
me to the quick. There was never a day during
those first three years at Mosgiel, but the wound
ached and smarted. Long afterwards, I reminded
the old gentleman of his jest; and he most solemnly
assured me that he had not the slightest recollection
of ever having uttered it. Which only proves that
our thoughtless thrusts are often just as painful as
our malicious ones. I have long since forgiven
my old friend. Indeed, I do not know that I have
much to forgive. For, after all, his stinging jibe
only made me resolve to prove its falsity. For more
than a thousand mornings I rose from my bed vowing
that at the end of three years, and at the end
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
of thirty, the broom should be sweeping as cleanly
as ever. The old minister has been in his grave
for many years now; and I have nothing but benedictions
to heap upon his honored name.</p>

<p>The cult of the new broom is a most pernicious
one. No heresy has done more harm. The
woman who really believes that new brooms sweep
clean will endeavor to keep the broom new as long as
she possibly can. And that is not what brooms are
for. Brooms are to use; and, as soon as you begin
to use them, they cease to be <span class='it'>new</span> brooms. The
point is a vital one. About three hundred years ago,
one of the choicest spirits in English history was
passing away. George Macdonald says of him that
one of the keenest delights of the life to come will
be the joy of seeing the face of George Herbert
'with whom to talk humbly will be in bliss a higher
bliss.' As George Herbert lay dying, he drew from
beneath his pillow the roll of manuscripts that contained
the poems that are now so famous. 'Deliver
this,' he said, 'to my dear brother, Nicholas Ferrar,
and tell him that he will find in it a picture of the
many spiritual conflicts that passed between God
and my soul before I could subject my will to the
will of Jesus my Master.' The verses were published,
and have come to be esteemed as one of the
priceless possessions of the Church universal. And
among them, strangely enough, I find a striking
reference to this matter of new brooms. 'What
wretchedness,' George Herbert asks,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span></p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>'What wretchedness can give him any room</p>
<p class='line0'>Whose house is foul while he adores the broom?'</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>And here is George Herbert telling us on his death-bed
that this reflects some deep spiritual conflict
between God and his own soul! What can he mean?
He means, of course, that it is possible to be so much
in love with your new dress that you are afraid to
wear it. You may be so enamored of your new
spade that you shrink from soiling it. You may—to
return to the poet's imagery—so adore your new
broom that you allow all your floors to become
dusty and foul.</p>

<p>And herein lies one of life's cardinal sins. In his
lecture on <span class='it'>The Valley of Diamonds</span>, John Ruskin
discusses the nature of covetousness. What is
covetousness? Wherein does it differ from the
legitimate desire for wealth? Up to a certain point
the desire for riches is admirable. It develops intellectual
alertness in the individual, and, in the
aggregate, builds up our national prosperity. If
nobody wished to be rich, the resources of the
country would never be exploited. Why should
men trouble to clear the bush or sink mines or erect
factories or cultivate farms? Apart from the lure
of wealth we should be a people of sluggish wit and
savage habits. Viewed in this light, the desire for
wealth is not only pardonable; it is admirable.
At what point does it curdle into covetousness and
threaten our undoing? Ruskin draws the line
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
sharply. The desire for wealth is good, he argues,
as long as we have <span class='it'>some use</span> for the riches that we
acquire; it deteriorates into mere covetousness as
soon as we crave to possess it for the sheer sake of
possessing it and apart from any <span class='it'>use</span> to which we
propose to put it. 'Fix your desire on anything
useless,' he says, 'and all the pride and folly of your
heart will mix with that desire; and you will become
at last wholly inhuman, a mere, ugly lump of
stomach and suckers, like a cuttlefish.' John
Ruskin's vigorous prose throws a flood of light on
George Herbert's cryptic poetry. So far as I have
it in my heart to use my new broom for the cleansing
of my home and the comfort of my fellows, my new
broom may be a means of grace to me and them;
but, so far as I view the new broom merely as a
possession, and irrespective of the service in which
it should be worn out, my pride in it is bad as bad
can be.</p>

<p>John Ruskin reminds me of Le Sage. 'Before
reading the story of my life,' he makes Gil Blas to
say, 'listen to a tale I am about to tell thee!' And
then he tells of the two tired and thirsty students
who, travelling together from Pennafiel to Salamanca,
sat down by a roadside spring. Near the
spring they noticed a flat stone, and on the stone
they soon detected some letters. The inscription
was almost effaced, partly by the teeth of time and
partly by the feet of the flocks that came to water
at the fountain. But, after washing it well, they
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
were able to make out the words '<span class='it'>Here is interred
the soul of the Licentiate Peter Garcias</span>.' The first
of the students roared with laughter and treated the
affair as purely a joke. 'Here lies a <span class='it'>soul</span>!'—what
an idea! A soul under a stone! The second, however,
took it more seriously and began to dig. He
at length came upon a leather purse containing a
hundred ducats, and a card, on which was written
in Latin the following sentence: '<span class='it'>Thou who hast
had wit enough to discover the meaning of the
inscription, inherit my money, and make a better
use of it than I have!</span>'</p>

<p>'The <span class='it'>soul</span> of the Licentiate Peter Garcias!'</p>

<p>'Make <span class='it'>a better use</span> of it than I have!'</p>

<p>Poor Peter Garcias felt that his shining ducats
had been a curse and not a blessing, because he
had loved them for their own sake instead of for
the sake of the use to which they could be put.
'Make <span class='it'>a better use</span> of them than I have!' he
implored. Peter Garcias would have understood
exactly what George Herbert meant by the worship
of the new broom.</p>

<p>But I need not have gone abroad for my illustration.
It is a far cry from George Herbert to
George Eliot; yet George Eliot has furnished us
with the most telling exposition of George Herbert's
recondite remark. For George Eliot has given us
<span class='it'>Silas Marner</span>. Indeed, she has given us two Silas
Marners. We have Silas Marner the miser, gloating
greedily over the guineas that he afterwards lost;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
and, later on, we have Silas Marner, strong, unselfish,
tender-hearted, rejoicing in the wealth that he
has now regained. Let us glance, first at the one
and then at the other.</p>

<p>We peep at him as he appears in the second
chapter. 'So, year after year, Silas Marner had
lived in this solitude, his guineas rising in the iron
pot, and his life narrowing and hardening itself
more and more into a mere pulsation of desire and
satisfaction that had no relation to any other being.
His life had reduced itself to the functions of
weaving and hoarding, <span class='it'>without any contemplation
of an end towards which the functions tended</span>.
Marner's face shrank; his eyes that used to look
trusting and dreamy now looked as if they had
been made to see only one kind of thing for which
they hunted everywhere; and he was so withered
and yellow that, although he was not yet forty,
the children always called him "Old Master
Marner."'</p>

<p>This was Silas Marner the miser! Then followed
the loss of the money; the hoarded guineas were
all stolen, and Silas was like a man demented!
Then little Eppie stole into his home and heart.
When he saw her for the first time, curled up on
the hearth, the flickering firelight playing on her
riot of golden hair, he thought his long-lost guineas
had come back in this new form, and he loved <span class='it'>her</span>
as he had once loved <span class='it'>them</span>. He would take her
on his knee and tell her wonderful stories, and,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span>
in the long summer evenings, would stroll out into
the meadows, thick with buttercups, and would
make garlands for her hair and teach her to distinguish
the songs of the birds. And so the years go
by till Eppie is a bonny girl of eighteen—always in
trouble about her golden hair, for no other girl of
her acquaintance has hair like it, and, smooth it as
she may, it will not be hidden under her pretty
brown bonnet. And then comes the great discovery.
The pond in the Stone Pit runs dry, and in its slimy
bed are found the skeleton of the thief and—the
long-lost guineas! That evening Silas and Eppie
sat together in the cottage. George Eliot describes
the transfiguration which his love for Eppie had
effected in the countenance of Silas. 'She drew
her chair towards his knees, and leaned forward,
holding both his hands, while she looked up at
him.' On the table near them, lit by a candle, lay
the recovered gold—the old long-loved gold, ranged
in orderly heaps, as Silas used to range it in the days
when it was his only joy. He had been telling her
how he used to count it every night, and how his
soul was utterly desolate till she was sent to him.</p>

<p>'Eh, my precious child,' he cried, 'if you hadn't
been sent to save me, I should ha' gone to the
grave in my misery. The money was taken away
from me in time; and you see it's been kept—kept
till it was wanted for you. It's wonderful—our life
is wonderful!'</p>

<p>It is indeed! But the wonderful thing for us
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
at this moment is the contrast between these two
Silas Marners. They are both rich. But the first
is rich and wretched; the second is rich and happy.
And the secret! The secret is that, in his first
possession of the guineas, he loved them for their
own sake, irrespective of any use to which they
could be put; in his subsequent possession of the
self-same guineas he loved them for the sake of the
happiness that they could purchase for Eppie.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>first</span> Silas Marner knew the wretchedness
that George Herbert describes—the wretchedness
of the man 'whose house is foul while he adores
his broom'; the <span class='it'>second</span> Silas Marner was willing
that the broom should be worn out in sweeping all
the obstacles and difficulties out of Eppie's path.</p>

<p>In telling her story, George Eliot remarks incidentally
that wiser men than Silas Marner often
repeat his mistake. The only difference is that,
while Silas Marner amassed <span class='it'>money</span> without considering
the uses to which it could be put, these
wiser misers accumulate <span class='it'>knowledge</span> in the same
aimless way. They abandon themselves to some
erudite research, some ingenious project or some
well-knit theory; and it brings them little joy because
it stands related to no actual need. It is a new
broom and will remain a new broom; it will never
brush away any of the world's sorrows or sweep
together any of its long-lost treasures. Knowledge,
like money, is a noble thing. But, as with money,
so with knowledge, it derives its nobleness from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
ends which it is designed to compass. Every
nation has a right to rejoice in its universities.
The university is the glory of civilization. But,
unless we keep both eyes wide open, the university
may come to resemble the hole in the cottage
floor in which Silas Marner hoarded his gold. Let
the student of engineering remember that he is
accumulating knowledge, not that he may possess
more of it than his rivals and competitors, but that
he may do more than they towards surmounting
the obstacles that block the path of human progress.
Let the medical student remember that he is amassing
knowledge, not that he may flourish the
academic distinctions he has won, but that he may
lessen the sum of human anguish and save human
life. And let the theological student reflect that
he is winning for himself a scholarly renown, not
that he may rejoice in his attainments and distinctions
for their own sake, but that, by means of them,
he may the more effectively and skillfully lead all
kinds and conditions of men into the kingdom and
service of his Lord.</p>

<p>And so I come back to my starting-point. The
broom that sweeps clean is not a new broom. After
commencing this chapter I happened to pick up a
report of the British and Foreign Bible Society.
On one of its pages I find a story told by the society's
colporteur at Port Said. He boarded an incoming
steamer, and, on the lower deck, found a German
sailor sweeping out a cabin. The man was greatly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
depressed. In the course of conversation, each
claimed to be a greater sinner than the other.</p>

<p>'What!' exclaimed the sailor, 'why, you are the
first man to tell me that he is a greater sinner than
I am!'</p>

<p>He took a Gospel from the colporteur's hands and
began to read.</p>

<p>'Ah,' he sighed, 'that I were a little child again
and could read it with a clean heart!'</p>

<p>The remark was overheard by some of his shipmates.</p>

<p>'Is that <span class='it'>you</span>, Jansen?' they asked; 'what wonder
has happened to you?'</p>

<p>'No wonder at all,' the man replied. '<span class='it'>I want to
sweep out my heart, and I am buying a broom!</span>'</p>

<p>The broom that he bought is by no means a new
one, but it sweeps wonderfully clean for all that!</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>VII—A GOOD WIFE AND A GALLANT SHIP</h1>

<h2>I</h2>

<p>Why is a good wife like a gallant ship? This is
not a riddle; it is a sincere and earnest inquiry.
An ancient philosopher in the East and a modern
poet in the West have both remarked upon the
resemblance between the two. Solomon spent nearly
half his life thinking about ships. He was the
only Jewish king who felt much enthusiasm for
maritime affairs. Solomon reminds me of Peter the
Great. Those who have perused Waliszewski's
biography of that monarch are scarcely likely to
forget the passage in which the historian describes
the finding, by the boy Peter, of the broken boat.
It was only an old, half-rotten wooden skiff, thrown
to the scrap-heap with some useless lumber in the
little village of Ismailof; but, captivating the boy's
fancy, and stirring his imagination, he could not
take his eyes from it. It changed the whole current
of his life. He is destined to rule over a great continental
people who have no access to the sea. Yet,
from that day, he dreams of nothing but brave ships
and romantic voyages. He comes to England to
learn shipbuilding. He returns to Russia and builds
useless navies. He claps his hands in delirious
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>
ecstasy as he launches his huge toys on his inland
lakes. He is like a caged eagle; the passion of the
infinite throbs in his veins, yet he is cribbed, cabined,
and confined in this cruel way!</p>

<p>Solomon was in a very similar case. He ruled
over a people who regarded the sea with distrust
and disdain. Yet he himself heard in his soul the
challenging call of the mighty waters. The ships!
The ships that bring the food! The merchant
ships! The ships that lie becalmed in the oily seas
of the tropics; the ships that get caught in the ice-pack
at the poles; the ships that fight their way
doggedly through howling gales and icy blizzards
round the cape! Those stately ships, with their
dizzy masts and shapely bows, captivated his
imagination; and when he desired to speak of the
virtuous and faithful housewife in terms of superlative
appreciation, the only image that seemed
worthy of her was the gallant ship riding at anchor
in the bay. '<span class='it'>Who can find a virtuous woman?</span>'
he asks, '<span class='it'>for her price is far above rubies. She is
like the merchant ships; she bringeth her food from
afar.</span>'</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>So much for the Eastern philosopher; now for
the Western bard! Longfellow likens a good wife
to a gallant ship; and, in order that we may see
how much alike the two are, he places them side by
side. He describes the old shipbuilder who has
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
resolved to build one more ship, his last and his
best. He comes down to the yards, his eyes sparkling
with enthusiasm, carrying the model in his
hand. He approaches his assistant, shows him
the model, and confides to him his dream. The
younger man, a stalwart and fiery youth, has a
dream of his own. He aspires to marry his master's
daughter. The two are engrossed in conversation,
the elder man depicting to the younger the stately
ship that is to be. He will build a vessel that shall
laugh at all disaster, and with wave and whirlwind
wrestle. And he concludes his eager communication
by promising that 'the day that giveth her to the
sea shall give my daughter unto thee.' The younger
man starts at the radiant prospect.</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>And as he turned his face aside</p>
<p class='line0'>With a look of joy and a thrill of pride.</p>
<p class='line0'>Standing before her father's door</p>
<p class='line0'>He saw the form of his promised bride.</p>
<p class='line0'>The sun shone on her golden hair</p>
<p class='line0'>And her cheek was glowing fresh and fair</p>
<p class='line0'>With the breath of morn and the soft sea air.</p>
<p class='line0'>Like a beauteous barge was she——</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>And so on. All through the poem, right up to the
wedding on the ship's deck on the day of her launching,
Longfellow draws the analogy between the
shapely vessel, the bride of the ocean, and the fair
maiden, the bride of the proud young builder.</p>

<p>'<span class='it'>She is like the merchant ships!</span>' says the ancient
Eastern sage.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span></p>

<p>'<span class='it'>Like a beauteous barge was she!</span>' exclaims the
Western poet.</p>

<p>It is difficult to resist the testimony of two such
witnesses.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>Neither the good wife nor the gallant ship need
resent the analogy. If the good wife does not like
being compared to a ship, let her sit down for five
minutes and think, and it will occur to her that,
of all our ingenious inventions and bewildering contrivances,
a ship is the only one that has a divine
origin and a divine authority. The ark was the
first ship; and its plans and specifications were
divinely dictated. Moreover, it is obvious that,
since the Lord God divided His world into islands
and continents, with vast expanses of ocean rolling
between, and commanded that all those scattered
territories should be peopled and developed, He
contemplated the existence of the ships. The ships
were part of the original programme. The ships
were to be the instruments of those distributive and
mediative ministries on which the history of the
world was to be based.</p>

<p>Or, if instead of thinking abstract thoughts, the
good wife prefers to read, let her reach down
Rudyard Kipling's ballad of the <span class='it'>Big Steamers</span>.</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>'Oh, where are you going to, all you Big Steamers,</p>
<p class='line2'>With England's own coal, up and down the salt seas?'</p>
<p class='line0'>'We are going to fetch you your bread and your butter.</p>
<p class='line2'>Your beef, pork, and mutton, eggs, apples, and cheese,</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>82</a></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>For the bread that you eat, and the biscuits you nibble,</p>
<p class='line2'>The sweets that you suck and the joints that you carve,</p>
<p class='line0'>They are brought to you daily by all us Big Steamers,</p>
<p class='line2'>And if anyone hinders our coming you'll starve!'</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>The ships, then, represent the indispensabilities of
life, the things without which we cannot live. I am
writing here in Australia. And even here in Australia,
with our immense open spaces, spaces in which
we can grow almost anything, how dependent we are
upon the coming of the ships! We need the ships;
ships to bring us our supplies from the great looms
and factories of the old world; ships to take the
produce of our boundless plains to the congested
populations of the other hemisphere; ships to bring
the letters for which our hearts are hungry, and to
take the letters for which distant friends are waiting.
Even here in Australia the ships are the light
of our eyes and the breath of our nostrils. Even
here in Australia, the good wife, when she spreads
her table in the morning, brings her food from afar.
For none of these dainties that tempt my appetite
and nourish my frame are <span class='it'>native</span> foods. They were
not here until the ships began to come. The wheat
is not indigenous; the meat is not native meat. The
corn and the cattle and the coffee came to Australia
on the ships. And, but for the ships, we ourselves
could never have been here. Let a man
register a vow that he will not eat, drink, wear or
use anything that has—in a remote or in an immediate
sense—been upon a ship; and he will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
reduced to abject wretchedness in no time. God
has built His world in such a way that the ship is
the foundation of everything.</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>Each climate needs what other climes produce,</p>
<p class='line0'>And offers something to the general use;</p>
<p class='line0'>No land but listens to the common call,</p>
<p class='line0'>And, in return, receives supplies from all.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>The Great Weaver stands continually at His loom
working out an intricate and beautiful pattern. The
nations are the threads that run up and down, up
and down, not far apart, yet never meeting. The
gallant ship is the shuttle, the busy shuttle, that flies
to and fro, to and fro, weaving them all into one
compact and wonderful whole. The web depends
entirely on the shuttle; the world depends entirely
on the ships.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p>I never see a great ship come into port at the end
of a long voyage without feeling a sense of admiration,
amounting almost to awe, at the masterly
achievement. To say nothing of the perils to which
she has been exposed at sea, it seems an amazing
thing that, after having been for months on the
trackless waters, she can pick up the heads as easily
as though she had been following a well-blazed trail.
There is a famous story on record in the <span class='it'>Memoirs of
Captain Basil Hall</span>. It tells how the erudite commander
once brought his vessel round Cape Horn on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>84</a></span>
a voyage from San Blas to Rio de Janeiro. Without
any other observations than those of the sun and
moon, he laid his vessel, in a thick fog, outside what
he believed to be the entrance to the harbor. The
fog cleared, and the land slowly loomed up through
it—the first that had been seen for more than three
months. It was Rio! The sailors were electrified
at the accuracy of their commander's calculations,
and, rushing to the bridge, greeted him, by way of
congratulation, with three ringing cheers! I suppose
no man ever watched a brave ship drop anchor
in the bay at the end of her voyage without some
such feeling as this. And certainly no man ever
looked into the face of his bride on his wedding day
without being conscious of some such emotion.
'<span class='it'>She is like the merchant ship; she bringeth her food
from afar.</span>' It seems so wonderful to the bridegroom
that she should have reached his side in
safety. The chances against her safe arrival were
a million to one. She is the daughter of a thousand
generations. For countless centuries her ancestors
were fighting men. If, in that long chain of warring
progenitors, only one had fallen before he mated,
she could never have been born. Time after time,
in those rude days, the earth was desolated by war,
pestilence, and famine; yet the line of genealogy
that led to <span class='it'>her</span> remained unbroken! More than
once whole nations were depopulated by the plague.
But still her ancestry was unaffected. The providence
that guards the good ship on the seething
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
waters, bringing it safely through storm and tempest
to its desired haven, watched over her as she floated
down the restless ages to her husband's side. She
was like the ark, upborne by the very waters that
destroyed everything beside; or, to return to Solomon's
simile, '<span class='it'>she is like the merchant ships; she
bringeth her food from afar</span>.' Her safe arrival
seems a miracle, and a golden miracle at that. It
seems to her husband that, threatened by such perils
as she has braved, only an escort of angels could
have brought her safely to his side. And he bows
his head in wondering gratitude.</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p>We owe everything to the ships. All our food
comes from afar. Yes, all of it, including food for
thought. The school, the college, the university;
they all resemble the virtuous housewife spreading
her table. They bring food from afar. Only this
afternoon I was shown over Dennington College.
The Principal, Miss Gertrude Milman, B.A., took
me into a class-room in which a geography lesson
was in progress. The teacher was giving her pupils
food from afar. Hardy adventurers and patient
explorers sailed across unknown seas, charted unknown
lands, and returned with the priceless results
of their hazardous investigations. And those results,
brought home by the ships, were being dispensed
in the class-room at Dennington College.
Miss Milman herself teaches philosophy. But she
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
owes it all to the ships. Far away over the sea,
Plato and Aristotle and Socrates wrestled with the
problems of the universe in the old days; and far
away over the sea Kant and Hegel and Bergson
pondered those same problems in a later time; and
the ships have brought us the wealthy fruitage of
their profound cogitations. 'And here,' Miss Milman
told me, 'the girls assemble in the morning for
the scripture lesson.' I do not know exactly how
that half-hour is spent; but I am certain that, even
then, Miss Milman sets before her pupils food from
afar. The Bible itself has come to us across the
ocean. The world is only rolling into light because
the ships, with their white sails, have dotted
every sea. 'The prayers you offer,' says J. M.
Neale, 'the prayers you offer, the hymns you sing,
the books of devotion you use, how far, far hence
in <span class='it'>time</span>, how far, far hence in <span class='it'>distance</span>, do their
sources lie? Perhaps from some quaint mediæval
German house, with its surrounding fields and lanes
and gardens buried deep in snow, you get a prayer
which we use at Christmastide. Perhaps from
the dog days of an Andalusian Convent, with its
orange trees and its pomegranates and its fountains,
you get such music as that lovely introit, "Like as
the hart desireth after the waterbrooks." Perhaps
from the tomb of a martyr you get such a hymn as
"O God, Thy soldiers' crown and guard." Prayers,
music, hymns; they are all the same. They come
from afar, from afar. I left Dennington College
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>
feeling that, after all, Miss Milman is very much
like Solomon's housewife; she is entirely dependent
on the ships; she bringeth her food from afar.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p>Now that I come to look a little more closely at
the comely features of this virtuous woman—the
woman who is like the merchant ships—I fancy
that I recognize her. For she is none other than
the Bride, the Lamb's wife. When the Church
spreads her white cloth, and sets her wondrous
table, she invariably decks it with food from afar.
Listen as she invites you to partake of her heavenly
fare!</p>

<p>'<span class='it'>The body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was
given for thee, preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting
life. Take and eat this in remembrance that
Christ died for thee, and feed on Him in thy heart
by faith with thanksgiving.</span>'</p>

<p>And listen again:</p>

<p>'<span class='it'>The blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was
shed for thee, preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting
life. Drink this in remembrance that Christ's
blood was shed for thee and be thankful.</span>'</p>

<p>Food from afar! Food from afar! She is like
the merchant ships; she bringeth her food from
afar! Such viands can have been procured from
no earthy source. This Bread was made from
wheat that grew in no earthly field; this Wine was
pressed from clusters that hung on no earthly vine.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
The happy guests who sit at the Church's table find
that, as they partake of her sacred hospitalities,
there is ministered to them a comfort that wipes all
tears from all faces, a hope that transfigures with
strange radiance every unborn day, and a peace
that passeth all understanding. They know, as they
taste this delectable fare, that such fruits grew in
no earthly garden. And then, with faces that shine
like the faces of the angels, they remember at whose
table they are seated, and they say one to another,
'<span class='it'>She is like the merchant ships; she bringeth her
food from afar.</span>' And that golden testimony is
true.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>I—ODD VOLUMES</h1>

<p>We have had a kind of wedding in my study
this morning. The bride arrived by post. It
happened in this wise. Twenty years ago I attended
an auction sale at Mosgiel. A valuable
library was under the hammer and the chance was
too good to be missed. The books were all tied up
in bundles and laid out on tables. I took a note of
the numbers of those lots that contained works that
I wanted. When, on the arrival of the carrier's
cart, I proudly inspected my purchases, I found
among them an odd volume. It was the first part
of <span class='it'>Foster's Life and Correspondence</span>. The book
was bound up with a number of others, and I could
not buy <span class='it'>them</span> without becoming responsible for <span class='it'>it</span>.
My first inclination was to throw it away; and the
temptation recurred when I left Mosgiel for Hobart,
and again when I left Hobart for Armadale. Of
what use was an odd volume? In packing up at
Hobart I actually tossed it to the heap of rubbish
that was to be left behind; but an aching void in
the last case led to its ultimate rescue. This is the
first part of our little romance.</p>

<p>Last week I was visiting a country minister.
In the ordinary course of things, I glanced over his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
book-shelves. I was just turning away, when,
among some dusty volumes away on the topmost
shelf, my eye caught the words <span class='it'>Foster's Life and
Correspondence</span>. It, too, was an odd volume. On
hearing of my own experience, the good man urged
me to transfer the volume to my portmanteau and
say no more about it. It was, he said, of no use
to him.</p>

<p>'But, my dear fellow,' I replied, 'I might just as
well say that <span class='it'>mine</span> is of no use to <span class='it'>me</span>. We must
leave the matter in the meantime. It is so long
since I looked at the volume on my shelves that I
cannot be sure that they are companions. They
may be duplicates. Yours, I see, is <span class='it'>Volume Two</span>.
If, on my return, I find that mine is <span class='it'>Volume One</span>,
we will come to some arrangement. If not, neither
of us can help the other.'</p>

<p>My Mosgiel purchase turned out to be the <span class='it'>first</span>
volume. I posted my friend a copy of <span class='it'>Bleak
House</span>, which, as I happened to know, he had never
read, and he forwarded the <span class='it'>Foster</span> by return of
post. And this morning I took the odd volume
from the lumber on the top shelf, introduced it to its
mate, and now the two stand proudly side by side
among my biographies. They make a handsome
pair: no bride and bridegroom could look more
perfectly matched. I do not suppose that they
had ever met before; but that circumstance in itself
presents no lawful impediment to their being united
in a lifelong partnership.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>93</a></span></p>

<p>The mating of books is a very mechanical affair.
At a big publishing house you may see two huge
cases side by side, just as they have come from the
printer's. The one is packed with copies of <span class='it'>Volume
One</span>; the other contains copies of <span class='it'>Volume Two</span>.
An assistant, asked by a customer for a copy of
the complete work, takes a book from the one box
and a book from the other; claps them together
with a bang; and they are mated for all time to
come. There is no question of selection, and no
question of consent. There is no '<span class='it'>Wilt thou have...</span>' and
no <span class='it'>'I will</span>.' The volume in the top
right-hand corner of the one box is unable to steal
a shy and furtive glance at the book lying in a
corresponding position in the other box. His
destined partner may be a little plumper or a little
thinner than himself; she may be neatly attired in
a pretty cover that sets off her charms to perfection,
or she may be dressed in an ill-fitting wrapper that
is smudged or torn; he cannot tell. He can only
wait, and she can only wait, until they are unceremoniously
snatched from their respective corners,
banged together, and thus, for richer for poorer,
for better for worse, made partners in a bond that
is indissoluble. There is no question of sexual
selection such as Darwin, Wallace, and the great
biologists like to portray. The books in the one
box do not strut and parade and show off their
beauties in order to win the admiration of the books
in the other box. That may be because they are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
conscious that they are all so much alike; they
feel that there is little to pick and choose between
them; or, on the other hand, it may be because
they suspect that the books in the other box are all
much of a muchness, and that it matters very little
which bride each bridegroom has. But, whatever
the reason, there it is! There is no element of
selection such as we find in the fields and the forests;
there is no lovemaking and courtship such as we
mortals know; the volumes are arbitrarily paired
off, and the thing is done.</p>

<p>And, strangely enough, they appear to belong to
each other from that very moment. One would
feel that he was conniving at a kind of literary
adultery if he were to take the second volume of
<span class='it'>this</span> set and the second volume of <span class='it'>that</span> set and
deliberately transpose them. I call the earth and
the heavens to witness that, in my procedure this
morning, I have been guilty of no such enormity.
We are living in a rough world. With some books,
as with some people, things go hardly. In the
course of years a volume may be cruelly deserted
by its companion; or its partner may come to an
untimely end. The law of the land provides that
in such sad cases, a second marriage is no shame.
One does not like to think of my first volume of
<span class='it'>Foster</span> spending all its days among the lumber on
<span class='it'>my</span> top shelf, and of my friend's second volume
spending all its days in the dust and neglect of <span class='it'>his</span>
top shelf. I do not often take my stand on my
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
ministerial dignity; but I maintain that, being a
minister, I have at least as good a right as any
publisher's assistant to take those two sad and
lonely volumes—the one from my top shelf in the
city, and the other from my friend's top shelf in the
country—and to unite them in the holy bond of
matrimony. And as they stand before me side by
side—never to perch upon a top shelf any more—I
feel that I have done myself, my friend and them
good service by having taken pity on their loneliness
and launched them on a united career of happiness
and usefulness. As things stood, neither was of
any use to anybody; their union has made it possible
for each to fulfill its destiny.</p>

<p>Let it be distinctly understood that I am not
writing of <span class='it'>single</span> volumes. A single volume is not
an <span class='it'>odd</span> volume. As I sit here at my desk and survey
my shelves, I see at a glance that many of the books
are complete in one volume. It would be the height
of absurdity for me to take one such book, say
<span class='it'>Pilgrim's Progress</span>, and another such book, say
<span class='it'>Pickwick Papers</span>, and declare them <span class='it'>Volumes One</span>
and <span class='it'>Two</span> for the mere sake of pairing them off.
Neither the publisher's assistant nor the minister
is vested with authority to mate the books after so
arbitrary a fashion. The <span class='it'>Pilgrim's Progress</span> is a
single volume, and the <span class='it'>Pickwick Papers</span> is a single
volume; and it is better for them to do the work
that they were sent into the world to do as single
volumes, rather than to enter into an alliance that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
will make them each ridiculous and stultify them
both. I am not arguing for the celibacy of the
clergy or for the celibacy of the laity; how could
I consistently adopt such a line of reasoning immediately
after having celebrated the marriage of
the <span class='it'>Fosters</span>? I am simply telling all the single
volumes in my study—who are looking a little
downcast and unhappy now that the excitement of
the wedding is past—that <span class='it'>single</span> volumes are not
<span class='it'>odd</span> volumes. It is very nice, of course, to be happily
mated; but it is quite possible for a solitary
life to be a very useful one. Robert Louis Stevenson
would have gone further. In his <span class='it'>Virginibus
Puerisque</span> he as good as says that no man can be a
hero after he is married. The fact that he has a
home of his own, and is surrounded by love and
tenderness and thoughtful care, militates against
the culture of the sterner virtues. 'If comfortable,'
Stevenson says, 'marriage is not heroic. It inevitably
narrows and damps the spirit of generous
men. In marriage a man becomes stark and selfish,
and undergoes a fatty degeneration of his moral
being. The air of the fireside withers up all the fine
wildings of the husband's heart. He is so comfortable
and happy that he begins to prefer comfort
and happiness to anything else on earth, his
wife included. Yesterday he would have shared
his last shilling; to-day his first duty is to his
family,' and is fulfilled in large measure by laying
down vintages and husbanding the health of an
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>97</a></span>
invaluable parent. Twenty years ago this man was
equally capable of crime or heroism; now he is fit
for neither. His soul is asleep, and you may speak
without restraint; for you will not waken him.</p>

<p>In his references to women, Stevenson does not
speak quite so confidently. 'It is true,' he says,
'that some of the merriest and most genuine of
women are old maids, and that those old maids,
and wives who are unhappily married, have often
most of the motherly touch. And this would seem
to show, even for women, the same narrowing
influence in comfortable married life.' Yet, on the
other hand, he feels that marriage affects a woman
differently. It makes greater demands upon her.
The very comfort which is the husband's peril is
largely the fruit of her thoughtfulness, her industry
and her unselfishness. With wifehood, too, comes
motherhood; and motherhood, side by side with
felicities that only mothers know, inflicts a ceaseless
discipline of suffering and self-denial. 'For
women,' Stevenson admits, 'there is less danger.
Marriage is of so much use to a woman, opens out
so much more in life, and puts her in the way of so
much freedom and usefulness that, whether she
marry ill or well, she can hardly miss the benefit.'
And he sums up by advising you, 'If you wish the
pick of men and women, take a good bachelor and
a good wife.' Since, however, if all women became
good wives, all men could not remain good
bachelors, it is obvious that Stevenson is crying for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>
the moon. But he has said enough to dispel the
gloomy and downcast looks that disfigured the
countenances of all my single volumes immediately
after the wedding. Single volumes are certainly
not odd volumes; they are complete in themselves;
and we are all very glad of them.</p>

<p>But there are odd volumes. Charles Wagner says
that 'in certain shelters for old people, where
husbands and wives may pass a tranquil old age
together, a very expressive term is used to designate
one who is left alone. The bereft solitary is called
<span class='it'>an odd volume</span>. How appropriate—like a book
astray from its companion tome! Odd volumes
indeed, those who have hitherto been one of two
inseparables! They celebrated their silver and
golden weddings, and suddenly find themselves
desolate. They seem like guests left behind at the
end of the feast or the play; the lights are out, the
curtain is down; they wander about in the emptiness
like souls in torment, possessed with the idea of
continually searching for something they have lost.
They hardly refrain from asking "Have you seen
my husband?" "Where shall I find my wife?"
Odd volumes, these!' And you may find them in
palaces as well as in almshouses. Did we not all
hear the cry that rang through the halls of Windsor
on the day on which the Prince Consort passed
away? 'I have no one now to call me "Victoria"!'
And there are others. They knew no golden wedding,
no silver wedding, no wedding at all; and yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
felt themselves mated. Some, like Evangeline and
Gabriel—and like my two <span class='it'>Fosters</span>—are separated
by distance and ignorance of each other's whereabouts.
Some, like Drumsheugh and Marget Howe,
are separated by the iron hand of circumstance;
some are kept apart by cruel misunderstandings and
mistaken judgments; and some—</p>

<p>The purest spirit that ever walked this earth of
ours was—I say it reverently—an odd volume.
I do not mean that He was a single volume: I
mean far more than that. He felt that He was not
single: He was not complete in Himself. In some
wonderful and mystical way, Deity and Humanity
were odd volumes; volumes that were intended to
supplement and complete each other; volumes that
had become alienated and torn asunder. The amazing
thing about the Scriptures is that, in both
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>100</a></span>
Testaments, they employ the very phraseology of
mating and marriage. The quest that led to the
Cross is the quest of the lover for His betrothed;
and the consummation of all things is to be a marriage
supper—the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.
And it may be that, in the larger, the lesser is included.
It may be that when Deity and Humanity,
so long estranged, are at length perfectly united,
other odd volumes will find their mates and the
isolations of this life be swallowed up in the glad
reunions of the life everlasting.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>101</a></span>II—O'ER CRAG AND TORRENT</h1>

<h2>I</h2>

<p>Lexie Drummond had a place of her own in the
hearts of the Mosgiel people. To begin with, she
was lonely; and lonely folk have a remarkable
way of exacting secret homage. Lexie worked at
a loom in the woollen factory, and lived by herself
in one of the factory cottages near by. I wish
you could have seen it. The door invariably stood
open, even when Lexie was away at her work.
Everything was faultlessly natty and clean. An
enormous tabby cat, 'Matey,' purred on the mat,
while a golden canary sang bravely from his cage
in the creeper just outside the door. Lexie had a
trim little garden, in which she grew lavender and
mignonette, roses and carnations. Lexie's white
carnations always took the prize at our local Flower
Show. Lexie mothered Mosgiel. If anybody was
in trouble, she would be sure to drop in; and, in
cases of serious sickness, she would often stay the
night. Some people would deny that Lexie was
beautiful; yet she had a loveliness peculiar to herself.
She was tall, finely-built, and wonderfully
strong. When Roger Gunton, the heaviest man on
the plain, was seized with sudden illness, and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
body was racked with excruciating pain, Lexie alone
could turn him from side to side, and he would allow
nobody else to touch him. If her face lacked the
vivacity and sparkle of more voluptuous beauties,
it possessed, nevertheless, a quiet gravity, a serious
winsomeness, that rendered it extremely attractive.
The furrows in her face, and the strands of
grey in her hair, made her look older than she
really was. Everybody knew Lexie's age; her name
was a perpetual reminder of the number of her
years. For, in an unguarded moment, she had
once revealed the circumstance that she was born
on the day on which the Princess of Wales—afterwards
Queen Alexandra—was married, and she
was named after the royal bride. Mosgiel never
forgot personal details of that kind. In addition
to all this, Mosgiel vaguely suspected that Lexie
carried a secret in her breast. She came to Mosgiel
only a few years before I did; and everybody felt
that her previous history was involved in tantalizing
mystery.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>It was Friday night. In the dining-room at the
Mosgiel manse we were enjoying a quiet evening by
the fire. I was lounging in an armchair with a
novel. I could afford to be restful, for, that week,
I had but one sermon to prepare. On the approaching
Sunday, the anniversary of the Sunday school
was to be celebrated; in the morning John
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>103</a></span>
Broadbanks and I were exchanging pulpits in
honor of the occasion; and, availing myself of a
minister's immemorial prerogative, I had decided
to preach an old sermon at Silverstream. All at
once we were startled by the ringing of the front door
bell. It was the Sunday school superintendent.</p>

<p>'We are in an awful hole,' he exclaimed, after
having discussed the weather, the health of our
respective families, and a few other inevitable preliminaries.
'Lexie Drummond has been taken ill,
and the doctor won't hear of her leaving the house
for a week or two. She has been preparing the children
for their part-songs, and has the whole programme
at her fingers' ends; I don't know how on
earth we are going to manage without her.'</p>

<p>I promised to run down and see Lexie about it
first thing in the morning; and did so. Lexie was
confined to her bed, and old Janet Davidson was
nursing her. 'Matey' was curled up close to his
mistress's feet, while the canary was singing
blithely from his cage near the open window. I
saw at a glance that Lexie had been crying, and I
attributed her grief to anxiety and disappointment
in connection with the anniversary. She quickly
undeceived me.</p>

<p>'You'll never notice that I'm not there,' she said,
with a watery smile. 'The children know their
parts thoroughly, and Bella Christie, who has been
helping me, is as familiar with the program as I
am.'
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span></p>

<p>I assured her that we should miss her sadly; but
expressed my relief that everything had been so
well arranged.</p>

<p>'And now, Lexie,' I said, as I took her hand in
parting, 'you must worry no more about it; we
will do our very best to make it pass off well.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' she replied, quickly, recognizing in my
words a reference to her tell-tale eyes, 'it wasn't
the anniversary that I was worrying about; indeed,
it was silly of me to cry at all!' And, to show how
extremely silly it was, she broke, with womanish
perversity, into a fresh outburst of tears.</p>

<p>'She has something she wants to tell you,' Janet
interposed, 'but she doesn't like to.'</p>

<p>Lexie pretended to look vexed at the old lady's
garrulity; but I fancied that I detected, behind the
frown, a look of real relief.</p>

<p>'Some other time,' she said. 'Good-bye, I shall
think of you all to-morrow!' Janet opened the
door and I left her.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>The anniversary passed off happily; Lexie was
soon herself again; and, a fortnight later, I saw
her in her old place at church. We knew that she
would insist on taking her class in the afternoon;
so, to save her the long walk home, we took her
to the manse to dinner.</p>

<p>'Several of the teachers have been telling me
of the address that you gave on the evening of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
the Sunday school anniversary,' she said, on our
way to the manse. 'I wish you would let me see
the manuscript.'</p>

<p>'I can do better than that,' I replied. 'The address
was printed in yesterday's <span class='it'>Taieri Advocate</span>.
I have several copies to spare if you care to have
one.'</p>

<p>On arrival at the manse she insisted on going
round the garden and admiring the flowers before
composing herself on the sofa in the dining-room.
I gave her the paper I had promised her, and hurried
away to prepare for dinner. When I returned a few
minutes later the paper was lying on the floor beside
her, and she was crying as if her heart would
break. By a supreme effort she regained her self-possession,
promised to explain in the afternoon,
and, in obedience to the summons, took her place at
table.</p>

<p>During dinner I mentally reviewed the address
which had so strangely reopened the fountains of
her grief. It was the address which, under the
title 'The Little Palace Beautiful,' appears in <span class='it'>The
Golden Milestone</span>. It begins: 'There are only four
children in the wide, wide world, and each of us
is the parent of at least one of them.' The first
of the four is <span class='it'>The Little Child that Never Was</span>.
'He is,' the address says, 'an exquisitely beautiful
child. He is the child of all lonely men and lonely
women, the child of their dreams and their fancies,
the child that will never be born. He is the son
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
of the solitary.' And the address goes on to quote
from Ada Cambridge's <span class='it'>Virgin Martyrs</span>:</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>Every wild she-bird has nest and mate in the warm April weather,</p>
<p class='line2'>But a captive woman, made for love, no mate, no nest, has she.</p>
<p class='line0'>In the spring of young desire, young men and maids are wed together,</p>
<p class='line2'>And the happy mothers flaunt their bliss for all the world to see;</p>
<p class='line2'>Nature's sacramental feast for them—an empty board for me.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>Time, that heals so many sorrows, keeps mine ever freshly aching,</p>
<p class='line2'>Though my face is growing furrowed and my brown hair turning white.</p>
<p class='line0'>Still I mourn my irremediable loss, asleep or waking;</p>
<p class='line2'>Still I hear my son's voice calling 'Mother' in the dead of night,</p>
<p class='line2'>And am haunted by my girl's eyes that will never see the light.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>As the address came back to me, I began to understand.
I remembered what the gossips said about
the mystery in Lexie's life. What was it, I
wondered, that she meant to tell me after dinner?</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p>'You don't know me!' she cried passionately,
when, once more, we found ourselves alone together.
'You treat me as if I were a good woman; you let
me work at the church, and you bring me into your
home; but you don't know me; really, really, you
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>107</a></span>
don't! I have committed a great sin, a very great
sin; and I am suffering for it; and others are suffering
for it.' She paused, as if wondering how to
begin her story, and then started afresh.</p>

<p>'I was brought up in the country,' she said, 'not
far from Hokitui. My parents both died when I
was a little girl; my guardians followed them a few
years ago; so that now I am quite alone. At school
I became very fond of Davie Bannerman, and
he made no secret of his partiality for me. He
used to bring me something—an apple or a cake or
a picture or some sweets—every day. When I
was nineteen we became engaged and were both
very happy about it. Everybody in the Hokitui
district loved Davie; he was handsome and good-natured;
I used to think his laugh the grandest
music I had ever heard. But I was proud, terribly
proud. And, being proud, I was selfish. And,
being selfish, I was jealous. Davie was good to
everybody; yet I could not bear to see him paying
attention to anybody but myself. He was a member
of the Hokitui church, and used to spend a good
deal of time there. I had no interest in such things
in those days, and I was angry with him for neglecting
me. But most of all was I jealous of Sadie
McKay. Sadie was his cousin; she was one of the
church girls; and I hated to think, when he was not
with <span class='it'>me</span>, that he was with <span class='it'>her</span>. Davie always took
my scoldings merrily, and quickly coaxed me into a
better mind. And I dare say that all would have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>108</a></span>
gone well but for the accident that spoiled everything.</p>

<p>'Sadie was riding in from the farm one morning
when, on the outskirts of Hokitui, she met a traction
engine. Her horse bolted, and was soon out
of control. As luck would have it, Davie was standing
at a shop door near the township corner, and
saw the horse galloping madly towards him. He
rushed into the road and managed to check the
animal before Sadie was thrown; but, in doing so,
he was hurled to the ground, and the horse trod on
his right arm, crushing it. He lay in the hospital
for nearly two months; but I never went near him.
When he left the hospital he wrote to me. It was
a pitiful scrawl, written with his left hand; his
right was amputated. "I have had a heavy loss,"
he said, "and I do not know how I can manage
without my arm; but now I must suffer a still
heavier loss, and I do not know how I can live
without <span class='it'>you</span>. But it would not be right for me
to burden you, and you must find somebody else,
Lexie, who can care for you better than I can."
I returned the engagement ring, and that was the
end of it. If he had lost his arm in any other way
I could have endured life-long poverty with him;
but to have lost his arm for Sadie!' She paused
and seemed to be looking out of the window, but
I knew that her story was not finished.</p>

<p>'A few months later I took a situation in Ashburton.
There I met, at a party, a young
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>109</a></span>
Englishman—Horace Latchford—who took a fancy to me.
He was visiting New Zealand for the sake of his
health. He told me that he owned a large estate in
Devonshire, and would make me a perfect queen.
During his stay—a period of about four months—life
was one long frolic. Six months later he sent
for me to go to him; and I went. But my eyes were
soon opened. There was no estate in Devonshire;
Horace was often intoxicated when he came to see
me; and, instead of getting married, I returned to
New Zealand in disgust. I came to Mosgiel, partly
because I knew that I could get good work in the
factory, and partly because I knew that nobody
here would know me. Since I returned from
England, ten years ago, I have only met one person
who knew me in the old days at Hokitui. I was
spending a holiday at Moeraki, and she was staying
at the same boarding-house. I did not tell her
that I had settled at Mosgiel; but she told me that
none of the Bannermans were now living at
Hokitui. Davie, she said, was the first to leave. He
went to one of the cities to learn a profession that
did not imperatively demand the use of two hands.'
She paused again, and I waited.</p>

<p>'When I came to Mosgiel,' she went on, 'I
got in the way of coming to the church. I became
deeply impressed, and you received me into membership.
And, every day since, as I have done little
things, and taken little duties, in connection with
the work, I have come to understand Davie as I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>
never understood him in the old days. I hated his
fondness for the church. And, every day now,
my sin seems to be more and more terrible. Just
lately it has been with me night and day. And when
I read your address my punishment seemed greater
than I could bear. I have prayed thousands of times
that the dreadful tangle might be unravelled. I
have not prayed selfishly; I could be perfectly contented
if only I knew that Davie is happy, and
that his faith in God and womanhood has not been
shaken by my wickedness. We sang <span class='it'>Lead, Kindly
Light</span> in church this morning. Do you think that
God really guides us? Does He put us right even
when we have done wrong? Will He straighten
things out? I would give anything to be quite
sure! I seem to be in a maze, and can find no way
out of it!'</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p>It seemed an infinite relief to Lexie to have told
me her story. She was much more often at the
manse after that; a new bond seemed to have sprung
up between us. I fancied that there came into
Lexie's face a deeper peace and a greater content.
The peace was, however, rudely broken. About
two years after Lexie had unburdened her soul to
me, I opened the paper one morning and confronted
a startling announcement. The personal
paragraphs contained the statement that '<span class='it'>Mr. David
Bannerman, the brilliant Auckland solicitor, has been
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>
appointed Lecturer in Common Law at the Otago
University.</span>' There followed a brief outline of the
new professor's career which left no shadow of
doubt as to his identity. I particularly noticed that
there was no reference to his marriage. What, if
anything, was to be done? The Otago University
was in Dunedin, only ten miles from Mosgiel.
Ought I to allow these two people to drift on, perhaps
for years, eating their hearts out within a few
miles of each other? Was it not due to Davie that
he should know that Lexie was at Mosgiel? He
might desire to <span class='it'>seek</span> her; or he might desire to
<span class='it'>avoid</span> her; in either case the information would be
of value. I stated the position in this way to Lexie,
but she would not hear of my taking any action.
After a while, however, she agreed to my writing,
telling the professor-elect that I knew of her whereabouts.
I added that she was universally loved and
honored for her fine work in the church and in the
district. I enclosed a copy of 'The Little Palace
Beautiful,' and mentioned the fact that I had once
caught her weeping bitterly as she read it. It took
four days for a mail from Mosgiel to reach Auckland.
After a long talk with Lexie, I posted my
letter on a Sunday evening. On Friday afternoon
I received a reply-paid telegram: '<span class='it'>Wire lady's address
immediately.</span>'</p>

<p>The new professor was married three months
after entering upon the duties of his chair at the
University; and, when I last saw her, Lexie was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span>
enthroned in the center of a charming little circle.
I received a letter from her yesterday—the letter
that suggested this record. She tells me, with pardonable
pride, that her eldest boy has matriculated
and also joined the church.</p>

<p>'I am getting to be an old woman now,' she says,
'and I spend a lot of time in looking backward.
Isn't it wonderful? It all came right after all!
But for the accident, Davie would never have been
a professor; and, if we had been married in the
old days, I should only have been a drag and a
hindrance. As it is, we have passed o'er moor and
fen, o'er crag and torrent; but the Kindly Light
that I once doubted has led us all the way!'</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span>III—THE PRETENDER</h1>

<h2>I</h2>

<p>'<span class='it'>Let's pretend!</span>' cried Jean.</p>

<p>They were enjoying a romp after tea; but the
game had been suddenly interrupted.</p>

<p>'How can we drown him when there's no water?'
asked Ernest, looking wonderfully wise.</p>

<p>'Oh, let's pretend the lawn's the water!' replied
Jean, brushing aside with impatience so trifling a
difficulty.</p>

<p><span class='it'>Let's pretend!</span> I used to wonder why Bonnie
Prince Charlie was called the Pretender, as though
he enjoyed some monopoly in that regard. We are
all pretenders. Some, perhaps, are more skilful
than others. Jean was especially clever. One day a
lady called and gave her a beautiful bunch of
flowers. Ernest was particularly fond of flowers,
and thought that he could capture them by guile.</p>

<p>'I say, Jean,' he cried, 'let's have a game! We'll
'tend the flowers are mine!'</p>

<p>'All right,' Jean replied, with a sly twinkle, 'and
you 'tend you've got 'em!'</p>

<p>Precisely! There is no end to the possibilities of
pretending. It is the one game of which we never
grow tired. We learn to play it as soon as we are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
out of the cradle and it still fascinates us as we
totter on the brink of the grave. Indeed, as H. C.
Bunner shows, childhood and age often play the
game together. Look at this!</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>It was an old, old, old, old lady,</p>
<p class='line2'>And a boy who was half-past three;</p>
<p class='line0'>And the way that they played together</p>
<p class='line2'>Was beautiful to see.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>She couldn't go running and jumping,</p>
<p class='line2'>And the boy no more could he,</p>
<p class='line0'>For he was a pale little fellow,</p>
<p class='line2'>With a thin, little twisted knee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>They sat in the yellow sunlight,</p>
<p class='line2'>Out under the maple tree;</p>
<p class='line0'>And the game that they played I'll tell you,</p>
<p class='line2'>Just as it was told to me.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>It was Hide-and-Seek they were playing,</p>
<p class='line2'>Though you'd never have known it to be—</p>
<p class='line0'>With an old, old, old, old lady,</p>
<p class='line2'>And a boy with a twisted knee.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>The boy would bend down his face, close his eyes,
and guess where she was hiding. He was allowed
three guesses. She was in the china-closet!
Wrong! Well, she was in the chest in Papa's
bedroom—the chest with the queer old key! Wrong
again; but warmer! Well, then, she was in the
clothes-press! It was his third guess, and it was
right. In the clothes-press she was! It was his turn
to hide and Granny's turn to guess!
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'>115</a></span></p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>Then she covered her face with her fingers,</p>
<p class='line2'>Which were wrinkled and white and wee;</p>
<p class='line0'>And she guessed where the boy was hiding,</p>
<p class='line2'>With a one and a two and a three.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>And they never had stirred from their places</p>
<p class='line2'>Right under the maple tree,</p>
<p class='line0'>This old, old, old, old lady</p>
<p class='line2'>And the boy with the lame little knee.</p>
<p class='line0'>This dear, dear, dear, old lady</p>
<p class='line2'>And the boy who was half-past three.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>It is the oldest game in the world; it was played—just
as it is played to-day—before any other game
was dreamed of, and the children of to-morrow will
be playing it when the games of to-day are all forgotten.
It is the most universal game in the world;
it is played in Pekin just as it is played in London;
it is played in Mysore just as it is played in New
York; it is played in Timbuctoo just as we play it
here in Melbourne. The rules of the game never
alter with the period or change with the place. It
is equally popular in all grades of society. The
royal children play it in the palace-grounds and the
street urchins play it in the alleys and the slums.
For the beauty of it is, that it needs no paraphernalia
or tackle or gear; you have not to buy a
bat or a ball, a racket or a net; you do not require
special grounds or courts or links. The 'old, old,
old, old lady,' and 'the boy with the twisted knee'
take it into their heads to have a game; and, then
and there, without moving an inch or getting a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>
thing, they set to work and play it! Jean cries,
'Let's pretend!' and straightway everybody is pretending!</p>

<p>'Let's pretend!' cried Jean. There was nothing
original in the suggestion. If the words are not
actually a quotation from Shakespeare, it is perfectly
certain that Shakespeare uttered them. They
voice the very spirit of the drama. The play and
the pantomime are all a matter of pretending. It
happened last evening that I had an appointment
in the city. I had promised to meet a friend on the
Town Hall steps at half-past seven. I was early;
it was a delicious summer's evening, and I enjoyed
watching the crowd. The crowd is always worth
watching, but at that hour the crowd is at its best.
The strain of the day is over and the weariness of
night has not yet come. The crowd is fresh,
vivacious, light-hearted. As I stood upon the steps,
I saw young men and maidens keeping their trysts
with each other; they were making no effort to
conceal their joy in each other's society; as they
tripped off together, they were laughingly anticipating
the entertainment to which they were hastening.
Gentlemen in evening dress, accompanied by handsome
women, beautifully gowned, swept by in
sumptuous cars that were brightly lit and daintily
adorned with choicest flowers. Here and there, in
this unbroken tide of traffic, I caught a glimpse of
features more quaint and of garments more
fantastic. I saw a troubadour, a viking, a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span>
knight-errant, a pierrot and a Spanish cavalier. I saw a
gipsy queen, a geisha-girl, a milkmaid, an Egyptian
princess, and a lady of the court of Louis the
Fourteenth. They were on their way to a fancy
dress ball at Government House. I stood entranced
as this pageant of pleasure swept past me, and a
strange thought seized my fancy. I reminded myself
that, in any one of ten thousand cities, I might
witness, at this same hour, an identically similar
spectacle. If I could have taken my stand in the
Strand in London, or in Princes Street, Edinburgh,
or in Sackville Street, Dublin, or in Broadway, New
York, or in the main thoroughfare of any city in
Christendom, I should have gazed upon a scene
which would have seemed like a mere reflection of
this one. And then I asked myself for an interpretation
of it all. What did it all mean—this throng
of happy pedestrians laughing and chatting as they
surged along the pavements; this ceaseless procession
of gay vehicles in the brilliantly-illumined roadway?</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>It is a tribute to our human passion for pretending.
His Excellency stands in the reception hall at
Government House and laughingly welcomes his
guests. They are pretenders, every one. The
troubadour is no troubadour; the viking, no viking;
the gipsy, no gipsy; and the milkmaid, no milkmaid.
They are just pretending and they have gone to all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>118</a></span>
this trouble and to all this expense that the full-orbed
joy of pretending may be for one crowded
hour their own. And the other people—the gentlemen
in evening dress; the ladies richly begowned
and bejewelled; the surging crowd upon the path.
They are making their way to the theatres. They
are going to see the great actors and actresses
pretend. One actor will pretend to be a cripple
and another will pretend to be a king; one actress
will pretend to be an empress and one will pretend
to be a slave; and the better the actors and
the actresses pretend the better these people will
like it.</p>

<p>For the people love pretending; that is how the
theatre came to be. Like Topsy, it had no father
and no mother. It sprang from our insatiable
fondness for make-believe. In his <span class='it'>Short History of
the English People</span> John Richard Green says that 'it
was the people itself that created the stage'; and he
graphically describes their initial ventures. 'The
theatre,' he says, 'was the courtyard of an inn or a
mere booth such as is still seen at a country fair;
the bulk of the audience sat beneath the open sky;
a few covered seats accommodated the wealthier
spectators while patrons and nobles sprawled upon
the actual boards.' In those days the audience had
to do its part of the pretending. If the spectators
saw a few flowers they accepted the hint and
imagined that the play was being enacted in a
beautiful garden. In a battle scene the arrival of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'>119</a></span>
an army was represented by a stampede across the
stage of a dozen clumsy sceneshifters brandishing
swords and bucklers. In order to assist the audience
to muster appropriate emotions, the stage was
draped with black when a tragedy was about to be
presented and with blue when the performance was
to portray life in some lighter vein. What is this
but a group of children playing at charades, at dressing-up,
at 'just pretending?' Children pretend in
order that they may escape from the limitations of
reality into the infinitudes of romance. Once they
begin to pretend all life is open to them. They have
uttered the magic 'Sesame' and every gate unbars.
Their seniors invade the same realm for the same
reason. This is the significance of those crowded
streets last night.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>Now this brings me to a very interesting point.
Is it wrong to pretend? In the greatest sermon
ever preached—the Sermon on the Mount—Jesus
called certain people hypocrites. But, did He, by
doing so, condemn all forms of hypocrisy? If so,
the people upon whom I looked last night were
all of them earning for themselves His malediction.
And so were the people gathered in the quaint old
English courtyard. And so was Jean when she
called to her playmates: 'Let's pretend!' And
so was 'the old, old, old, old lady' and 'the boy
with the twisted knee.' For a hypocrite—as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span>
very word suggests—is simply a pretender. A
hypocrite is one who colors his face, or dresses up
or acts a part. Does it follow, therefore, because
Jesus condemned the Pharisees and called them
hypocrites, that all pretenders fall beneath His
frown? To ask the question is to answer it. Fancy
Jesus frowning at Jean! Fancy Jesus frowning
at 'the old, old, old, old lady' and 'the boy with
the twisted knee!' Why Jesus Himself <span class='it'>pretended</span>
on occasions. He behaved towards the Syro-Phœnician
woman as though He had no sympathy
with her in her distress. He saw the disciples in
trouble on the lake; and, walking on the water,
He made as though He would have passed them by.
When, after journeying with two of His disciples to
Emmaus, He reached the door of their home, He
made as though He would have gone further! 'He
made as though!' 'He made as though!' 'He
made as though!' The feints of Deity!</p>

<p>Let a man but keep his eyes wide open and he
will see some very lovable hypocrites, some very
amiable pretenders, in the course of a day's march.
I have been reading <span class='it'>The Butterfly Man</span>. And here
in the early part of the book is a scene in which a
child and a criminal take part. Mary Virginia
shows John Flint a pasteboard box. It contains
a dark-colored and rather ugly grey moth with his
wings turned down.</p>

<p>'You wouldn't think him pretty, would you?'
asked the child.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>121</a></span></p>

<p>'No,' replied John Flint disappointedly, 'I
shouldn't!'</p>

<p>Mary Virginia smiled, and, picking up the little
moth, held his body, very gently, between her finger
tips. He fluttered, spreading out his grey wings;
and then John saw the beautiful pansy-like underwings,
and the glorious lower pair of scarlet velvet,
barred and bordered with black.</p>

<p>'I got to thinking,' said the girl, thoughtfully,
lifting her clear and candid eyes to John Flint's,
'I got to thinking, when he threw aside his plain
grey cloak and showed me his lovely underwings,
that he's like some people. You couldn't be
expected to know what was underneath, could you?
So you pass them by, thinking how ordinary and
uninteresting and ugly they are, and you feel rather
sorry for them—because you don't know. But if
you once get close enough to touch them—why, then
you find out! You only think of the dust-colored
outside, and all the while the underwings are right
there, waiting for you to find them! Isn't it
wonderful and beautiful? And the best of it all is,
it's true!'</p>

<p>In these artless sentences, tripping, so easily from
a child's tongue, Marie Oemler sums up the burden
of her book. The incident is a parable. For John
Flint was <span class='it'>himself</span> the drab and ugly moth. In the
opening chapters of the story, he is a horrible object—coarse,
brutal, loathsome, revolting. But there
were underwings. And gradually, beneath the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
touch of gentle influences, those underwings became
visible; and, in the later stages of the story, all
men admired and revered and loved the beautiful
nobleness of the Butterfly Man.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p>There are people, I suppose, who trick themselves
out to make themselves appear much prettier or
much nicer or—worse still—much holier than they
really are. 'Let's pretend!' they cry; and there
is something sinister in their pretending. It is
against these people—and against them only—that
the anathemas of the Sermon on the Mount are
directed.</p>

<p>Again, there are people who, like Ian Maclaren's
Drumtochty folk, go through life dreading lest their
underwings should be seen, their virtues exposed,
their goodness discovered. They bear themselves
distantly and give an impression of aloofness; you
would never dream, unless you got to know them,
that their dispositions were so sweet, their characters
so strong, their souls so saintly.</p>

<p>I am told that a great actor achieves his triumphs
through contemplating so closely the character that
he impersonates. His own individuality becomes,
for the time being, absorbed in another. Henry
Irving forgets that he is Henry Irving and believes
himself to be Macbeth. I have read of One who,
seeming to possess no form nor comeliness, nor any
beauty that men should desire Him, was nevertheless
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>123</a></span>
the chiefest among ten thousand and the altogether
lovely. It may be that these amiable pretenders
of whom we are all so fond have contemplated
so closely <span class='it'>His</span> character that they have unconsciously
caught His spirit and acquired His ways.
They cleverly conceal the rainbow-tinted underwings,
beneath a coat of drab; but, having once
caught a glimpse of their glory, we ever after feel
it shining through the grey.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_124' id='Page_124'>124</a></span>IV—ACHMED'S INVESTMENT</h1>

<h2>I</h2>

<p>Gilt-edged securities are all very well; but men do
not make their fortunes out of gilt-edged securities.
Gilt-edged securities may suit those whose circumstances
compel them to husband jealously their
meagre savings; but the big dividends are made out
of the risky speculations. There are investments
in which a man cannot, by any possibility, lose his
treasure, and in which he must, with mathematical
certainty, reap a modest margin of profit. And,
on the other hand, there are investments in which
a man may, quite easily, lose every penny that he
hazards, but in which he may, quite conceivably,
make a perfectly golden haul. An Eastern sage with
a well-established reputation for wisdom urges us to
venture fearlessly at times upon these more perilous
but more profitable ventures, '<span class='it'>Cast thy bread</span>,' he
says, '<span class='it'>upon the waters.</span>' The man who believes in
gilt-edged securities will prefer to cast it upon <span class='it'>the
land</span>. The land is a fixture. The land does not
float away or fly away or fade away. You find it
where you left it. It is stable, substantial, secure.
Because of its fixity, men trust it. For thousands
of years it was the bank of the nations. Men hid
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>125</a></span>
their treasures in fields, as many a lucky finder
afterwards discovered to his delight. But the
waters! <span class='it'>Cast thy bread upon the waters!</span> The
waters are the very emblem of all that is fickle, variable
and inconstant. They ebb and they flow; they
rise and they fall; they are restless, unstable,
fluctuating. They suck down into their dark depths
the treasures confided to their care and leave no
trace upon the surface of the hiding-place in which
the booty lies concealed. The waters! <span class='it'>Cast thy
bread upon the waters!</span> The man who believes only
in gilt-edged securities shakes his head. This is no
investment for him. But the man who can afford
to take desperate hazards pricks up his ears.</p>

<p>'The waters!' he exclaims. 'He tells me to cast
my bread upon the waters! It is the last place in
the world to which I should have thought of casting
it! But I shall venture!'</p>

<p>And he becomes immensely rich in consequence.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>Achmed Ali is a young Egyptian farmer. His
lands are in the Nile Valley, and, in the flood-time,
two thirds of his property is under water. But flood-time
is also sowing-time, and what is he to do?
He can, of course, sow that portion of his land that
stands above the waterline. And he does. This
is his gilt-edged security. He is practically certain
of getting back in the late summer the grain that
he sows in the spring, with a fair proportion of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>126</a></span>
increase in addition. But on that narrow margin
of profit Achmed Ali cannot support wife and children
and pay all the expenses of his farm. He
turns wistfully towards the river. He surveys the
section of his farm over which the waters are
sluggishly drifting. Sometimes they recede, leaving
a broad strip of shining, gurgling mud. He is
tempted to scatter his seed over that belt of ooze at
once. He waits a few hours, however, hoping that
the retreat of the waters will continue, and that, in
a few days, he will be able to carry his seed-basket
over the whole area that is now submerged. But his
hopes are soon shattered. The swaying waters come
welling in again and even lick the edges of the land
he has already sown. If only he could get at those
inundated fields! The land is soft and moist! It
has been enriched and fertilized by the action of the
flood-waters. Saturated by the moisture in the
soil, and warmed by the rays of the tropical sun, the
seed would germinate and spring up as if by magic;
and the harvest would beggar that of the land that
the river has never touched! But these are castles
in the air. The flood is there. It shows no sign
of withdrawing. He knows that, after it has gone,
it will be a day or two before he can cross the soft,
sticky, slimy soil with his basket. And by that
time the season may have passed. It will be too
late to sow.</p>

<p>It is to Achmed Ali that our Eastern sage is
speaking. 'Why wait for the flood?' he asks. '<span class='it'>Cast
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
thy bread upon the waters!</span> Much good grain—grain
that thou canst ill afford to lose—will float
away and never more be seen. Much of it will be
greedily devoured by fish and water-fowl. But
what of that? Much of it will drift about on the
shallow waters, and be deposited, as they recede, on
the soft warm mud from which they ebb. With thy
heavy feet and clumsy form and weighty basket thou
couldst not cross the soil till long after the waters
leave it. Let the waters do their work for thee!
Turn thy foe into a friend! Make of the tyrant a
slave! <span class='it'>Cast thy bread upon the waters!</span>'</p>

<p>It is no gilt-edged security; but Achmed Ali resolves
to take the risk.</p>

<p>Among the reeds round the bend of the river his
flat-bottomed boat is moored. He hurries up to the
barn for his basket of seed. He gazes almost
fondly, upon the precious grain that he is about to
invest in such a precarious speculation. He bears
it down to the boat and pushes out on to the shallow
waters. A tall ibis, stalking with stately stride along
the edge of the stream, is startled by the commotion
and flies away, flapping its wings with slow and
measured beat. Achmed is now well out upon the
river. The flood that had defied him now supports
him. He feels as the Philistines must have felt
when they harnessed Samson to their mill. He
paddles up to one end of his property and works his
way down to the other, scattering the seed broadcast
as he goes. Then, having disposed of every
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>128</a></span>
grain, he paddles back to his starting-point and ties
up his boat. He stands for a moment on the bank
watching the seed floating hither and thither upon
the eddying waters. In some places it is still strewn
evenly upon the tide; in others it has drifted into
snakelike formations that curl and straighten themselves
out again on the surface of the flood. It
seems an awful waste. But is it?</p>

<p>In a day or two the waters recede, leaving the
saturated seed strewn over the oozy soil. It sinks
in of its own weight and is quickly lost to view.
And then Achmed sees the wisdom of the counsel
he has followed. And in the summer, when he
garners a rich harvest from the very lands over
which his boat had drifted, he blesses that Eastern
sage for those wise words.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>In my old Mosgiel days, I was often invited to
address evening meetings in Dunedin. The trouble
lay in the return. A train left Dunedin at twenty
past nine and there was no other until twenty past
ten, or, on some nights, twenty past eleven. It
was sometimes difficult to leave a meeting in time
to catch the first of these trains, yet, if I stayed for
a later one, it meant a midnight arrival at the manse
and a woeful sense of weariness next morning. On
the particular night of which I am now thinking,
I missed the early train. There was no other until
twenty past eleven. I sat on the railway platform,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>129</a></span>
feeling very sorry for myself. When at length the
train started, I found myself sharing with one companion
a long compartment, with doors at either
extremity and seats along the sides, capable of accommodating
fifty people. He sat at one end and I
at the other. I expect that I looked to him as woebegone
and disconsolate as he looked to me. The
train rumbled on through the night. The light was
too dim to permit of reading; the jolting was too
great to permit of sleeping; and I was just about to
record a solemn vow never to speak in town again
when a curious line of thought captivated me. I
could not read; I could not sleep; but I could talk!
And here, in the far corner of the compartment,
was another belated unfortunate who could neither
read nor sleep and who might like to beguile the
time with conversation! And then it occurred to
me not only that I <span class='it'>could</span> do it but that I <span class='it'>should</span> do it.
We had been thrown together for an hour in this
strange way at dead of night; we should probably
never meet again until the Day of Judgement; what
right had I to let him go as though our tracks had
never crossed at all? Was the great message that,
on Sundays, I delivered to my Mosgiel people, intended
exclusively for them, and was it only to be
delivered on Sundays? I felt that my Sunday congregation
was a gilt-edged security; but here was a
chance for a rash speculation!</p>

<p>The train stopped at Burnside. I stepped out on
to the station and walked up and down for a moment
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>
inhaling the fresh mountain air. I wanted to have
all my wits about me and to be at my best. The
engine whistled, and, on returning to the compartment,
I was careful to re-enter it by the door near
which my companion was sitting, and I took the seat
immediately opposite to him. I then saw that he
was quite a young fellow, probably a farmer's son.
We soon struck up a pleasant conversation, and then,
having created an atmosphere, I expressed the hope
that we were fellow-travellers on life's greater
journey.</p>

<p>'It's strange that you should ask me that,' he said,
'I've been thinking a lot about such things lately.'</p>

<p>We became so engrossed in our conversation that
the train had been standing a minute or so at
Mosgiel before we realized that we had reached the
end of our journey. I found that our ways took us
in diametrically opposite directions. He had a long
walk ahead of him.</p>

<p>'Well,' I said, in taking farewell of him, 'you
may see your way to a decision as you walk along
the road. If so, remember that you need no one
to help you. Lift up your heart to the Saviour;
He will understand!'</p>

<p>We parted with a warm handclasp. Long before
I reached the manse I was biting my lips at having
omitted to take his name and address. However,
like Achmed Ali, I had cast my bread upon the
waters.</p>

<p>Five years passed. One Monday morning I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>131</a></span>
was seated in the train for Dunedin. The compartment
was nearly full. Between Abbotsford
and Burnside the door at one end of the carriage
opened, and a tall, dark man came through, handing
each passenger a neat little pamphlet. He
gave me a copy of <span class='it'>Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment</span>.
I looked up to thank him, and, as our eyes
met, he recognized me.</p>

<p>'Why,' he exclaimed, 'you're the very man!'</p>

<p>I made room for him to sit beside me. I told
him that his face seemed familiar, although I could
not remember where we had met before.</p>

<p>'Why,' he said, 'don't you remember that night
in the train? You told me, if I saw my way to a
decision, to lift up my heart to the Saviour on the
road. And I did. I've felt sorry ever since that
I didn't ask who you were, so that I could come and
tell you. But, as the light came to me in a railway
train, I have always tried to do as much good as
possible when I have had occasion to travel. I
can't <span class='it'>speak</span> to people as you spoke to me; but I
always bring a packet of booklets with me.'</p>

<p>I recalled the inward struggle that preceded my
approach that night. I remembered bracing myself
on the Burnside station for the ordeal. It seemed
at the time a very rash and risky speculation.</p>

<p>But here was my harvest! I have invested most
of my time and energy in gilt-edged securities, and,
on the whole, I have no reason to be dissatisfied with
the return that they have yielded me. But I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span>
seldom obtained from my gilt-edged securities so
handsome a profit as that unpromising venture ultimately
brought to me.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p>The only way to keep a thing is to throw it away.
The only way to hold your money is to invest it.
The only way to ensure remembering a poem is to
keep repeating it to others. If you hear a good
story and attempt to keep it for your own delectation,
you will forget it in a week. Laugh over it
with every man you meet and it will ripple in
your soul for years.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens, when I have finished one
of these screeds of mine, that I feel a fatherly
solicitude concerning it. You sometimes grow fond
of a thing, not because you cherish an inflated conception
of its value, but because through sheer
familiarity, it has become a part of you. So I look
at these white sheets over which I have been bending
for days and into which I have poured all my
soul. I feel anxious about them. Yet it is absurd
to keep them. If I store them away I shall soon forget
their contents and my labor will all be lost.
But the printer is six hundred miles away. I think
of all the hands through which they must pass on
their way from me to him. I register them at the
Post Office, but still I think of all the risks. These
white sheets of mine are such frail and flimsy
things; an accident, a fire, and where then would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>
they be? But one happy morning I see my screed in
print! I feel that I have it at last! It is beyond the
reach of fire or accident. If <span class='it'>this</span> house is burned
down, I can obtain a copy in <span class='it'>that</span> one! I feel that
nothing now can rob me of the child I brought into
being. It is scattered broadcast, and, having been
scattered broadcast, is at last my very, very own!</p>

<p>The only way to keep a thing is to throw it away.
Achmed Ali knows that. He looks fondly at the
grain in the basket but he knows that he cannot
keep it in the barn. 'Seeds which mildew in the
garner, scattered, fill with gold the plain.' And so
he casts some of it on the land—his gilt-edged
security—and gets it back with interest; and he casts
the rest upon the water—his risky speculation—and
gets it back many times multiplied.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>V—SATURDAY</h1>

<p>Saturday is the name, not so much of a day, as
of a specific phase of human experience. And it
is a great phase. We all catch ourselves at odd
moments living over again some of the unforgettable
Saturdays of long ago. In actual fact, a man may
be lounging in an armchair beside his winter fire or
sprawling on the lawn on a drowsy summer afternoon.
But, under such conditions, the actual fact
is soon relegated to oblivion. A far-away look
comes into his eyes, a wayward smile flits over his
face, and, giving rein to his fancy, he sees landscapes
on which his gaze has not rested for many a
long year. He roams at will among the golden
Saturdays of auld lang syne. He feels afresh the
mighty thrill that swept his soul when, after a long
heroic struggle, his side won that famous match
upon a certain village green; he lives again through
the fierce excitement of a paper-chase that led the
hare and hounds over the great green hills and
down through the dark pine forest in the valley;
he enjoys once more the birds'-nesting expedition in
the winding lane; and he sees, as vividly as he saw
them at the time, the shining trophies that rewarded
his fishing excursions to the millponds and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>135</a></span>
trout-streams of the outlying countryside. In those far-off
days, Saturday was the wild romance of the
week.</p>

<p>I remember being told by my first schoolmaster
that Saturday was named after Saturn, and that
Saturn was the planet that had rings all round it.
From that hour, by a singular confusion of ideas,
I always thought of Saturday as the day that had
the rings round it. I somehow associated the day
with the lady of the nursery rhyme who has rings
on her fingers and bells on her toes, and who, therefore,
has music wherever she goes. I liked to think
that Saturday moved among the other days of the
week in such melodious pomp and splendor. The
notion intensified the zest with which I welcomed
the great day. For Saturday was great; it was great
in its coming and great in its going. It began
gloriously and it ended gloriously. I do not mean
that it ended as it began. By no means. There is
one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon.
The glory of Saturday's dawn was one glory; the
glory of Saturday's dusk was another glory. Saturday
began like a Red Indian shouting his war-whoop
as he takes to the trail; it ended like a monk who, in
the stillness of his cloister, chants his evening hymn.</p>

<p>It takes a boy a minute or two, on waking, to
assure himself that it is really Saturday. He is not
quite sure of himself; the notion seems too good to
be true. He sits bolt upright; rubs his eyes; and
stares about him for some confirmation of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>
joyous suspicion that is bringing the blood to his
cheeks in excitement. Is it really Saturday? He
distrusts—and not without cause—the confused
sensations of those waking moments. He made a
mistake once before; he fancied that it was Saturday;
made all his plans accordingly; and discovered
to his disgust a few minutes later that it was only
Friday after all. That Friday, at any rate, was a
most unlucky day! But Saturday! With what
tingling exhilaration and boisterous delight the conviction
that it was Saturday fastened upon us!
Saturday was our day! We raced out after breakfast
like so many colts turned loose upon the heath.
We tossed up our caps for the sheer joy of it.
Whatever the ordeals of the week had been, we forgave
all our tyrants and tormentors on Saturday
morning. And in that gracious and benignant absolution
we experienced a foretaste of the saintliness
with which the great day wore to its close.</p>

<p>For Saturday, however spent, reached its climax
in a consciousness of virtue so complete and so
serene and so beatific as to be almost unearthly.
Such a delicious content seldom falls within the
experience of mortals. Saturday night was bath-night;
and few sensations in life are more delectable
than the angelic self-satisfaction that overtakes the
average boy after having been subjected to the
magic discipline of hot water and clean sheets. The
outward change is wonderful; but the inward transformation
exceeds it by far. He feels good; looks
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_137' id='Page_137'>137</a></span>
good; smells good; <span class='it'>is</span> good. A boy after a bath is
at peace with all the world. The week may have
gone hardly with him. Parents and teachers may
have shown a vexatious incapacity to see things
from a boy's standpoint; the proprietors of orchards
and gardens may have exhibited—perhaps even on
Saturday afternoon—a singular inflexibility in their
interpretation of the laws relating to property; the
world as a whole may have behaved in a manner
wofully inconsiderate and unjust. But on Saturday
night, under the softening influence of a hot bath
and a clean bed, a boy finds it in his heart to forgive
everything and everybody. A vast charity wells up
in his soul. As he lays his damp head on his snowy
pillow, he revokes all his harsh judgements and
cancels all his stern resolves. He will not run away
from home after all! Instead of abandoning his unfeeling
seniors to their hatred, malice and uncharitableness,
he will treat them with magnanimity
and tolerance; he will give them another chance.
It is possible—appearances to the contrary notwithstanding—that
they do not mean to be unsympathetic.
They simply do not understand. Thinking
thus the young saint falls asleep in the odor of
sanctity—and soap! The more wayward and
troublesome he has been in the daytime, the more
angelic will he appear under these new conditions.
Watching him as he slumbers, one of the Saturnian
rings seems to encompass his brow like a halo.
Saturday has come to an end!
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span></p>

<p>Now, this saintly young savage of ours will learn,
as the years go by, that life itself has its Saturday
phase. Dr. Chalmers used to say that our allotted
span of three score years and ten divides itself into
seven decades corresponding with the seven days
of the week. The seventh—the stretch of life that
opens out before a man on his <span class='it'>sixtieth</span> birthday—is,
the doctor used to say, a Sabbatic period. In
it, he should shake himself free, as far as possible,
from the toil and moil of life, and give himself to the
cultivation of a quiet and restful spirit. That being
so, it follows that the sixth period—the period that
opens out before a man on his <span class='it'>fiftieth</span> birthday—is
the Saturday of life. It is a great time, every
way. Like the Saturday of the old days, and like
the Saturday of riper years, it has characteristics
peculiarly its own. On his fiftieth birthday, if
Mr. J. W. Robertson Scott is to be believed, a man
enters the gates of a new world. It is not of necessity
a better world or a worse one; it is simply a
different one. We seldom enter upon a new experience
without finding that the change has involved
us in a few drawbacks and deprivations, as well as
in some distinct benefits and advantages. The step
that a man takes on his fiftieth birthday is no exception
to this rule. Mr. Robertson Scott caught sight
of the gates of the new era some time before he
actually reached them. 'In the tram, one evening,
about six months ago, a schoolboy rose and offered
me his seat,' he tells us. The incident startled him.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
A man who is still in the forties does not expect to
receive such courtesies. He consoled himself, however,
with the assumption that the attentive schoolboy
was probably a boy scout who had suddenly
realized that the day was closing in without his
having done the good deed prescribed for each
twenty-four hours of the life of the perfect Baden-Powellite.
Four months later, however, the same
thing happened again; and then, shortly after,
came the fiftieth birthday! Clearly it was Saturday
morning!</p>

<p>Now, the striking thing about Mr. Robertson
Scott's experience is the fact that his attainment
of his jubilee appealed to him, not as an end, but
as a beginning. It was not so much a premonition
of senility and decay as the entrance upon a fresh
phase of life. When Horace Walpole wrote to
Thomas Gray in 1766, urging him to write more
poetry, Gray replied that when a man has turned
fifty—as he had just done—there is nothing for
it but to think of finishing. He voiced the feeling
of the period. In the eighteenth century, a man
of fifty was classified among the veterans. A
hundred years later, a very different conviction
held the field. Tolstoy tells us that his fiftieth year
was the year of his greatest awakening and enlightenment;
and, in <span class='it'>The Poet at the Breakfast
Table</span>, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes makes the old
master witness to something of a similar kind. His
friends are anxious to know how and when he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_140' id='Page_140'>140</a></span>
acquired his wealth of wisdom; and he is able to reply
with remarkable precision: 'It was on the morning
of my fiftieth birthday that the solution of life's
great problem came to me. It took me just fifty
years to find my place in the Eternal Order of
Things.' Such testimonies go a long way towards
vindicating Mr. Robertson Scott's assumption that
the fiftieth birthday marks rather a new beginning
than a sad, regretful close. The fiftieth birthday is
Saturday morning; and who, on Saturday morning,
feels that the week is over?</p>

<p>On the contrary, Saturday morning is, to most
people, more insistent than any other morning
in its demands upon their energies. Walk up the
street on a Saturday afternoon, and you will see
your neighbors garbed and employed as they are
never garbed or employed on any other day. On
Saturday we weed the garden, mow the lawn and
effect the week's repairs. On Saturday we attend
to a multitude of minor matters for which we have
had no time during the week. On Saturday we
clear up. And on Saturday night we are tired.
It by no means follows, therefore, that, because a
man's fiftieth birthday is his Saturday morning,
his week's work is done. It is indisputable, of
course, that a man of fifty has left the greater part
of life behind him; he may be pardoned if he pauses
at times to take long and wistful glances along the
road that he has trodden; it will not be considered
strange if, on very slight provocation, he drops into
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>
a rapture of reminiscence. There is a subtle stage
in the development of fruit at which, having attained
its full size, it ripens rapidly. A man enters upon
that stage on his fiftieth birthday. A shrewd
observer has said that, like peaches and pears, we
grow sweet for awhile before we begin to decay.
The Saturday of life is sweetening time. We become
less harsh in our criticisms, less overbearing in
our opinions, more considerate towards our contemporaries
and more sympathetic towards our juniors.
The week's work is by no means finished. Much
remains to be done. But it will be done in a new
spirit—a Saturday spirit. And if the man of fifty
be spared to enjoy octogenarian honors, he will
smile as he recalls the immaturity and unripeness
of life's first five decades. It is a poor week that
has no Saturday and no Sunday in it. To have
finished at fifty, an old man will tell you, would
have meant missing the best.</p>

<p>It has often struck me as an impressive coincidence
that it was when Dr. Johnson was approaching
his fiftieth birthday—life's Saturday morning—that
he discovered a significance in Saturday that,
until then, had eluded him. He felt, as we all feel
on Saturdays, that the time had come to clear up,
to put things in their places and to overtake
neglected tasks. And this is the entry he makes in
his Journal:</p>

<p>'Having lived, not without an habitual reverence
for the Sabbath, yet without that attention to its
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>142</a></span>
religious duties which Christianity requires: I
resolve henceforth—<span class='it'>First</span>, to rise early on Sabbath
morning, and, in order to that, to go to sleep early
on Saturday night. <span class='it'>Second</span>, to use some more than
ordinary devotion as soon as I rise. <span class='it'>Third</span>, to
examine into the tenor of my life, and particularly
the last week, and to mark my advances in religion,
or my recessions from it. <span class='it'>Fourth</span>, to read the
Scriptures methodically, with such helps as are at
hand. <span class='it'>Fifth</span>, to go to church twice. <span class='it'>Sixth</span>, to
read books of divinity, either speculative or practical.
<span class='it'>Seventh</span>, to instruct my family. <span class='it'>Eighth</span>, to
wear off by meditation any worldly soil contracted
in the week.'</p>

<p>The significance of this heroic record lies in the
resolve that Saturday, so far from unfitting him
for Sunday, shall lead up to it as a stately avenue
leads up to a noble entrance-hall. 'I resolve to go
to sleep early on Saturday night.' Exactly a
hundred years after the great doctor had inscribed
this famous entry on the pages of his Journal,
Charlotte Elliott wrote her well-known hymn in
praise of Saturday:</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>Before the Majesty of heaven</p>
<p class='line2'>To-morrow we appear;</p>
<p class='line0'>No honor half so great is given</p>
<p class='line2'>Throughout man's sojourn here.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>The altar must be cleansed to-day,</p>
<p class='line2'>Meet for the offered lamb;</p>
<p class='line0'>The wood in order we must lay,</p>
<p class='line2'>And wait to-morrow's flame.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span>
I have heard scores of sermons on <span class='it'>The Proper
Observance of Sunday</span>; and, somehow, I have never
been impressed by their utility. One of these days
some pulpit genius will preach on <span class='it'>The Proper
Observance of Saturday</span>, and then, quite conceivably,
the new day will dawn.</p>

<p>As I lay down my pen, a pair of experiences rush
back upon my mind. The one befell me at sea,
the other on land.</p>

<p>1. In the course of a voyage from New Zealand
to England it became necessary—in order to
harmonize the clocks and calendars on board
with the clocks and calendars ashore—to take
in an extra day. We awoke one morning
and it was Saturday; we awoke next morning
and it was Saturday again! That second Saturday
was the strangest day that I have ever
spent. I never realized the extent to which
Saturday leads up to Sunday as I realized it
that day.</p>

<p>2. I once numbered among my intimate friends
a Jewish rabbi. I found his society extremely
delightful and wonderfully instructive. He often
took me to his synagogue, showed me its treasures,
and initiated me into its mysteries. It was all very
beautiful and very suggestive. But I invariably
came away feeling dissatisfied and disappointed.
I had been gazing upon the emblems and symbols
of a Saturday faith. Like that weird Saturday on
board the <span class='it'>Tongariro</span>, it was a Saturday that led to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>144</a></span>
a Saturday, a Saturday that ushered in nothing
holier or sweeter than itself.</p>

<p>Saturn with all his rings is grand; but the Sun
is grander still! It is from the Sun that Saturn
derives his brightness and his glory. Ask Saturn
the secret of his splendor, and it is to the Sun that
he unhesitatingly points. As it is with these mighty
orbs themselves, so is it with the days that bear
their names. As Samuel Johnson and Charlotte
Elliott knew so well, it is the glory of Saturday to
prepare the way for Sunday. Saturday belongs to
the Order of St. John the Baptist. John was the
greatest of all the sons of men, yet it was his mission
to clear the path for the coming of a greater. The
old world's Saturday-Sabbath, commemorating a
completed Creation, led up to the new world's
Sunday-Sabbath, commemorating a completed
Redemption. The oracles and mysteries that I
saw in the synagogue, the emblems and expressions
of a Saturday faith, were sublime. But their
sublimity lay in the fact that they pointed men to,
and prepared men for, a Sunday faith, a faith that
gathers about a wondrous Cross and an empty tomb,
a faith from which that Saturday faith, like Saturn
bathed in sunlight, derives alike its lustre and its
fame.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_145' id='Page_145'>145</a></span>VI—THE CHIMES</h1>

<p>It was Christmas Eve—an Australian Christmas
Eve. To an Englishman it must always seem a
weird, uncanny hotch-potch. He never grows
accustomed to the scorching Christmases that come
to him beneath the Southern Cross. Southey once
declared that, however long a man lives, the first
twenty years of his life will always represent the
biggest half of it. That is indisputably so. The
thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts. The
first twenty years of life fasten upon our hearts
sentiments and traditions that will dominate all
our days. I spent my first twenty Christmases
in the old land. I have spent far more than twenty
in the new. Yet, whenever I find old Father
Christmas wiping the perspiration from his brow as
he wanders among the roses and strawberries of our
fierce Australian mid-summer, I feel secretly sorry
for him. He looks as jolly as ever, yet he gives
you the impression of having lost his way. He
seems to be casting about him for snowflakes and
icicles.</p>

<p>But, as I was saying, it was Christmas Eve—an
Australian Christmas Eve. The day had been
sultry and trying. After tea I sauntered off across
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>146</a></span>
the fields to a spot among the fir-trees, at which I
can always rely upon meeting a few grey squirrels,
an old brown 'possum, and some other friends of
mine. I had scarcely taken my seat on a grassy
knoll, overlooking a belt of bush, when the laughing-jackasses
broke into a wild, unearthly chorus
in the wooded valley below. And then, a few
minutes later, the cool evening air was flooded with
a torrent of harmony that transported me across
the years and across the seas. The squirrels, the
'possum, and the kookaburras were left leagues
and leagues behind. From a lofty steeple that
crowned a distant crest there floated over hill and
hollow the pealing and the chiming of the bells.</p>

<p>The magic that slept in the lute of the Pied Piper
was as nothing compared with the magic of the bells.
Beneath the witchery of their music, time and space
shrivel into nothingness and are no more. We are
wafted to old familiar places; we see the old familiar
faces; we enter into fellowship with lands far off
and ages long departed. Frank Bullen heard our
Australian bells. He was only a sailor-boy at the
time. 'Often,' he says, 'I would stand on deck
when my ship was anchored in Sydney Harbor on
Sunday morning, and listen to the church bells
playing "Sicilian Mariners" with a dull ache at
my heart, a deep longing for something, I knew not
what.' The bells, according to their wont, were
annihilating time and space. Beneath the enchantment
of their minstrelsy he sped, as on angels'
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_147' id='Page_147'>147</a></span>
wings, away from the realities of his rough and
roving sea-life, into the quiet haven of a tender past.
He was back in his old seat in a little chapel in
Harrow Road. Every Englishman overseas will
understand.</p>

<p>The bells throw bridges across the yawning
chasms of space, and link up hearts that stand
severed by the tyrannies of time. In his <span class='it'>Golden
Legend</span>, Longfellow describes Prince Henry and
Elsie standing in the twilight on the terrace of the
old castle of Vautsberg on the Rhine. Suddenly
they catch the strains of distant bells. Elsie asks
what bells they are. The Prince replies:</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>They are the bells of Geisenheim,</p>
<p class='line0'>That, with their melancholy chime,</p>
<p class='line0'>Ring out the curfew of the sun.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>And then he adds:</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>Dear Elsie, many years ago</p>
<p class='line0'>Those same soft bells at eventide</p>
<p class='line0'>Rang in the ears of Charlemagne,</p>
<p class='line0'>As, seated at Fastrada's side,</p>
<p class='line0'>At Ingelheim, in all his pride,</p>
<p class='line0'>He heard their sound with secret pain.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>And so, through the melodious medium of the bells,
the royal lovers on the terrace cross the long centuries
that intervene and enter into fellowship with
those other royal lovers of an earlier time.</p>

<p>I remember, many years ago, spending a few days
at a beautiful country home in Hampshire. My
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_148' id='Page_148'>148</a></span>
hostess was a little old lady—<span class='it'>very</span> little and <span class='it'>very</span>
old. I can see her now with her prim little cap, her
golden earrings, and her silver ringlets. It was
summer-time, and one evening she invited me to
accompany her on a walk across the deer-park.
She was a happy little body, and that evening she
was specially vivacious. Her conversation was
punctuated with pretty ripples of silvery laughter.
She was too proud to confess to feeling tired; but
when we reached a stile with a step to it on the brow
of a hill, she took a seat upon the step—to drink in,
as she was careful to explain, the beauty of the view.
I perched myself upon the stile itself and watched
with interest the antics of a fine stag among some
oak-trees not far away. Then, all at once, the bells
from the village behind us rang out blithely. For
a while I listened in silence, and then turned to my
companion to ask a question. On glancing down
at her face, however, I was astonished to notice
tears upon her cheek. What could be the matter
with my gay little friend? I immediately transferred
my attention to the stag, who was by this
time ambling away across the park, but she knew
that I had seen the tear-drops. On our way back to
the house she explained.</p>

<p>'My mother died,' she said, 'while I was on my
honeymoon in Italy. I was only a girl, and she was
not much more. She was only twenty when I was
born, and I was only eighteen on my wedding day.
I never dreamed, when I left England, that I should
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_149' id='Page_149'>149</a></span>
never see her again. On the eve of my wedding
she came up to me, put her arm round me, and led
me away to spend one more hour alone with her.
We sauntered off to the stile on which you and I
rested this evening; and as we sat there, hand in
hand, the bells pealed out just as they did to-night.
And, as I listened to them just now, her face, her
form, her voice, her words—the very <span class='it'>feeling</span> of that
other evening more than sixty years ago—came
back upon me more vividly than they have ever
done before. I could almost fancy that I was a girl
again. My marriage, my children, my travels, and
my long widowhood seemed all a dream. It was
the bells that took me back again!'</p>

<p>I wonder if it was! I wonder if the great iron
bells that hung in the dusty old belfry of that
English hamlet knew anything of the sweet and
sacred secrets that my little old friend kept locked
up in that gentle heart of hers! I wonder if the
bells of Geisenheim knew anything of the loves of
Charlemagne and Fastrada, of Elsie and Prince
Henry! I wonder if the bells that drove the
squirrels from my mind that summer evening knew
anything of the Christmas thoughts and Christmas
memories with which they flooded my soul! I
wonder!</p>

<p>And, in my wonderment, I find myself in excellent
company. For here is little Paul Dombey! He
has only a few days to live, although, to-day, he is
slightly better and able to get about the house a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_150' id='Page_150'>150</a></span>
little. And, in moving about the house, he finds
a workman mending the great clock in the hall, and
Paul sees an opportunity of asking a few questions.
Indeed, Dickens says that he asked, not a few, but
a long string of them. 'He asked the man a multitude
of questions about chimes and clocks; as,
whether people watched up in the lonely church
steeples by night to make them strike, and how the
bells were rung when people died, and whether those
were different bells from wedding bells, or only
<span class='it'>sounded</span> different in the fancies of the living.' In
this last question, Paul gets very near to our own.
Do the bells say the things they seem to say, or
do they only <span class='it'>seem</span> to say those things? Did the
bells of Geisenheim speak of love to the lovers on
the castle terrace? Did the bells of that Hampshire
village speak to the little old lady in the deer-park
concerning the days of auld lang syne—her
happy girlhood and her mother's face? Did the
bells of that Australian steeple speak of the old-fashioned
English Christmases as their delicious
music fell on my delighted ears that summer night?</p>

<p>Of course not! The bells take us as they find
us and set us to music; that is all! Paul Dombey,
who died young, half suspected it; and Trotty
Veck of <span class='it'>The Chimes</span>, who lived to be old, proved it
from experience, and proved it up to the hilt. When
things were going badly with Trotty and Richard
and Meg, and the magistrate said that people like
them should be 'put down' with the utmost rigor of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
the law, the chimes, when they suddenly pealed out,
made the air ring with the refrain 'Put 'em down;
Put 'em down; Facts and Figures; Facts and
Figures! Put 'em down! Put 'em down!!' 'If,'
says Dickens, 'the chimes said anything, they said
this; and they said it until Trotty's brain fairly
reeled.' Later on in the story, we have the same
chimes, and the same people listening to them. But
this time all is going well: Meg and Richard are
to be married on the morrow: and Trotty is at the
height of his felicity. 'Just then the bells, the old
familiar bells, his own dear constant, steady friends—the
chimes—began to ring. When had they ever
rung like that before? They chimed out so lustily,
so merrily, so happily, so gaily, that he leapt to his
feet and broke the spell that bound him.' And, a
few minutes later, Trotty and Richard and Meg
were dancing with delight to the gay, glad music
of the bells!</p>

<p>When they themselves were sad, the chimes
seemed mournful; when they were glad, the chimes
seemed blithe. 'Are they different bells?' asked
little Paul Dombey, 'or do they only <span class='it'>sound</span>
different?' Paul was getting very near to the heart
of a great truth; and, if only Trotty Veck and he
could have talked things over together, they might
have given us a philosophy of bells that would have
immeasurably enriched our thought.</p>

<p>The chimes are among the things to which
distance lends enchantment. The bells, as my little
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_152' id='Page_152'>152</a></span>
old lady and I heard them from the deer-park, were
sweeter than the same bells heard in the churchyard
under the belfry. In his <span class='it'>Cheapside to Arcady</span>, Mr.
Arthur Scammell suggests that the music of the
bells awakens the echoes of all the infinites and all
the eternities. He finds himself up in the belltower.
'After the last stroke of the bell ceases to
be heard down in the church,' he says, 'the sound
is continued up here in a long diminuendo; and how
long will it be before that vibrant hum is completely
extinguished? All through the night, the air about
the bells may still be throbbing with faint echoes
and reverberations; and, if an hour or a night,
why not a year or a century? May not even the
sound of the first ringing of these old bells yet lisp
against the walls and roof in infinitesimal vibrations?
The tower may be alive with the thin ghosts
of all the joyous and mournful notes that have endeared
and embittered the sound of bells to hundreds
of human hearts.' And if, following the same line
of argument, the music of the bells falls so sweetly
on my ear as I sit upon my grassy knoll two miles
away from the steeple, who is to say that twenty
miles away, a thousand miles away, the air is not
trilling and trembling with their delicious melodies?
It may be only because my perceptive faculties are
so gross, my ears so heavy, that I do not, in this
Australian pleasance of mine, catch the chimes of
Big Ben and the echoes of Bow Bells. And if Mr.
Scammell's philosophy be true of bells, why not of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span>
other sounds? As I ponder his striking suggestion,
I find it more easy to understand that great saying
that <span class='it'>whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be
heard in the light, and that which ye have whispered
in the ear shall be shouted from the housetops</span>.</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>The deeds we do, the words we say,</p>
<p class='line2'>Into still air they seem to fleet;</p>
<p class='line4'>We count them past,</p>
<p class='line4'>But they shall last</p>
<p class='line0'>To the Great Judgment Day,</p>
<p class='line2'>And we shall meet!</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>The bells are not only <span class='it'>heard</span> at a distance, they
are <span class='it'>better heard</span> at a distance. It is possible to get
so near to them as to miss the music. In his autobiography,
James Nasmyth tells us of a visit he
paid to the tower of St. Giles, Edinburgh. He had
often been charmed by the chimes, and longed to
get nearer to them. But the experience brought
a rude disillusionment. 'The frantic movements
of the musician as he rushed wildly from one key
to another, often widely apart, gave me the idea
that the man was mad, while the banging of his
mallets completely drowned the music of the chimes.'
It is possible to get too near to things. You do
not see the grandeur of a mountain as you recline
upon its slopes. The disciples were too near to
Jesus; that explains some of the most poignant
tragedies of the New Testament. A minister,
through constant association with the sublimities
of divine truth, may lose the vision of their eternal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>
grandeur. And, unless things in the manse are
very carefully managed, the members of a minister's
family may easily suffer through being too near to
things. They do not see the mountain in its grand
perspective. The banging of the mallets drowns
the music of the bells.</p>

<p>One beautiful June evening, years ago, I was
walking along the banks of the Thames. It was
Saturday night; I had undertaken to preach at
Twickenham on the Sunday. All at once I was
arrested by the pealing of the bells. Strangers
stopped each other to inquire why the belfries had
become vocal at that strange hour. We learned
later that the bells were proclaiming the birth of
an heir to the British throne. A prince had been
born at White Lodge, just across the river! Well
might the bells peal that night!</p>

<p>Well, too, may the bells peal on Christmas Eve!
I like to think that, over the birth of <span class='it'>that</span> babe,
born in Bethlehem, and cradled in a manger, more
bells have been rung than over all the princes since
the world began. The Chinese cherish a lovely
legend concerning the great bell at Pekin. The
Emperor, they say, sent for Kuan-Yin, the caster
of the bells, and described the bell that he desired.
It was to be larger than any bell ever made, and
its tone more beautiful. Its music was to be heard
a hundred miles away. Great honors were to be
heaped upon the bell-maker if he succeeded; a
cruel death was to follow his failure. Kuan-Yin
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>155</a></span>
set to work; he mixed the costliest metals; he
labored night and day; and at last he finished
the bell. He tested it, and was disappointed. He
tried again, and was again mortified. He was at
his wits' end. Then Ko-ai, his beautiful daughter,
consulted an astrologer. The oracle assured her
that, if the blood of a fair virgin mingled with the
molten metals, the music would ravish the ears of
every listener. Ko-ai returned to the foundry;
and, when the glowing metal poured white-hot
from the furnace, she plunged into the shining bath
before her. The music of the great bell, the
Easterns say, is the music of her sacrifice. It is
only an Oriental myth; but it strangely helps me
to interpret to my heart the solemn sweetness that
I recognize in all these Christmas chimes.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>156</a></span>VII—'BE SHOD WITH SANDALS'</h1>

<p>Is there anything fresh to be said by way of a charge
to a young minister? I confess that, until this
morning, I thought not. But this morning, to
my inexpressible delight, I struck a vein that, so
far as I know, has never yet been exploited. On
these solemn and impressive occasions, we have
talked about the minister's <span class='it'>scholarship</span> and the
minister's <span class='it'>spirituality</span> until we have come to feel
that we have completely exhausted that line of
things. And in the process we have given the
awkward impression that the minister, so far from
being made of pretty much the same stuff as the
butcher, the baker, and the candlestick-maker,
is a kind of biological monstrosity consisting of a
very big head and a very big heart—and of <span class='it'>nothing
else</span>!</p>

<p>But this morning I made a discovery. Before
delivering a charge to a young minister, I took the
precaution to have a good look at him. And I
found to my surprise that, in addition to the head
and the heart upon which we have always laid such
inordinate emphasis, he also possesses a fine pair
of legs with a substantial pair of feet at the end of
them! Nobody could have supposed from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
most careful perusal of all the ministerial charges
in our literature, that any minister was ever before
known to possess these useful appendages; but
there they are! I saw them with my own eyes!
Perhaps those who delivered the great classical
charges only saw the young minister in the pulpit,
in which case the limbs which I this morning discovered
would naturally be invisible. Like the feet
of the seraphim in the prophet's vision, they would
be modestly concealed. But, though hidden, they
exist; and it occurred to me that a few very useful
things could be said concerning them. Why should
it be considered <span class='it'>infra dig.</span>, I should like to know, to
talk about people's feet, and especially about a minister's
feet? The Bible has no hesitation in talking
about them. 'How beautiful upon the mountains,'
said the prophet, 'are <span class='it'>the feet</span> of him that
bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that
bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation;
that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth.' And
did not the Master Himself, when He ordained His
first disciples, deliver to them this striking charge?
'<span class='it'>Take no shoes</span>,' He said, '<span class='it'>but be shod with sandals!</span>'
The African natives thought of Livingstone's boots
as a contrivance for carpeting all the slave-tracks of
Africa with leather, so that he might walk harmlessly
and painlessly along them; and when the
Saviour tells His first disciples to be shod with
sandals I fancy I see miles and miles of meaning in
those arresting words.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span></p>

<p>'<span class='it'>Be shod with sandals!</span>' It is an appeal for
ministerial simplicity. There were three classes of
people in Palestine. The slaves went barefoot; the
grandees wore elaborate shoes; the working classes
wore sandals. The sandals were simple, serviceable,
and strong. Therefore, said the Master to His men,
'<span class='it'>be shod with sandals!</span>' The line of simplicity is invariably
the line of strength. Gibbon has shown
us that it is the simplest architecture that has defied
both the vandalism of the barbarians and the teeth
of time. Macaulay has proved that it is the simplest
language that lasts longest. John Bunyan's books
threaten to survive all later literature. Why? 'The
style of Bunyan,' Macaulay says, 'is delightful to
every reader, and is invaluable as a study to every
person who wishes to obtain a wide command over
the English language. The vocabulary is the
vocabulary of the common people. There is not an
expression which would puzzle the rudest peasant.
Several pages do not contain a single word of more
than two syllables. Yet no writer has said more
exactly what he meant to say. For magnificence;
for pathos; for vehement exhortation; for subtle
disquisition; for every purpose of the poet, the
orator and the divine; this homely dialect, the
dialect of plain working men, was perfectly sufficient.
There is no book in our literature on which
we would so readily stake the fame of the old unpolluted
English language, no book which shows so
well how rich that language is in its own proper
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>159</a></span>
wealth, and how little it has been improved by all
that it has borrowed.' It is ever so. The simplest
language is the strongest language, and the simplest
lives are the strongest lives. In his 'Ode on the
Death of the Duke of Wellington,' Tennyson says
that the illustrious Duke was rich in saving commonsense.</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>And as the greatest only are</p>
<p class='line0'>In his simplicity sublime.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>Wherefore, said the Master, avoid the vulgarities
of the slave market on the one hand, and the stilted
affectations of the schools on the other. Let simplicity
ally itself with strength. '<span class='it'>Be shod with
sandals!</span>'</p>

<p>It is a great thing for Christ's minister to eschew
this vice of extremes. All through the ages the
pendulum of ecclesiastical fashion has been swinging
between bare feet and golden slippers. From the
excessive worship of unholy revelries, to which
the Roman world was abandoned, the Christians of
the first century went to the opposite extremity, and
courted persecution by their rigid abstinence from,
and their severe condemnation of, the most legitimate
and necessary pleasures. Back again swung
the pendulum, until the churches became the scenes
of voluptuous luxury and extravagance. We read
on, and the next chapters of our ecclesiastical histories
bring us to the story of the monks and the
hermits. We no sooner discover an age of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>160</a></span>
unexampled self-indulgence, than we straightway
come upon the Puritanism that banned <span class='it'>Pilgrim's
Progress</span> as a wanton frivolity, and that denounced
the <span class='it'>Fairy Queen</span> as a wicked and devilish invention!
And so we go on. One day Christ's minister would
go bare-footed like a slave; the next he must needs
affect a pair of golden slippers. There was a time
when the Church gloried in her poverty; her emissaries
wore no shoes on their feet; they dressed in
rags and tatters; they ate the berries of the hedgerow;
they drank the waters of the wayside spring.
And then, hey presto, the scene is changed. The
Church gloried in her wealth. All the world paid
tribute to the Popes. Rome rolled in riches; and her
proud bishop, Innocent the Fourth, laughed as he
looked upon his countless hoards and boasted that
never again need the Church lament that of silver
and gold she had none! Here is the Church going
barefooted like a slave; and here is the Church
mincing in golden slippers; and neither spectacle is
an edifying one. The Master urges His men to
avoid both the bare feet and the golden slippers.
Let your moderation be known unto all men. <span class='it'>Be
shod with sandals!</span></p>

<p>It is the solemn and imperative duty of a Christian
minister to conserve both the dignity and the
modesty of holy things. A certain offence in the
ancient law was to be punished by the deprivation
of dignity. '<span class='it'>Thou shalt loose his shoe from off
his foot, and his name shall be called in Israel, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_161' id='Page_161'>161</a></span>
house of him that hath his shoe loosed.</span>' Those
who have carefully read that graceful and dramatic
story unfolded in the Book of Ruth know the
bitterness of that reproach. The man whose shoes
were publicly removed was like an officer whose
stripes are taken from his arm in the sight of the
whole regiment. He became an object of derision
and contempt. Anyone, Dr. Samuel Cox points
out, might laugh at him and call him 'Old Baresole,'
and his family would be stigmatized as the family
of a barefooted vagabond. <span class='it'>Be shod with sandals!</span>
says the Master. Do not expose the Church to the
contempt of the multitude! Conserve her dignity!
Cast not her pearls before swine! Nor is such
dignity inconsistent with simplicity. Dr. Johnson
penning from his modest room at Gough Square,
that famous letter in which he proudly declined
the patronage of the Earl of Chesterfield, makes
a much more dignified picture than the gilded
aristocrat who tardily fawned to the great man's
fame. And George Gissing has shown that the
solitaries of Port Royal, reading and praying in
their poor apartments, cut a much more stately
figure in history than his refulgent Majesty, King
Louis the Fourteenth, strutting among the palatial
chambers and the spacious gardens of Versailles.
When I see the ministers of Christ organizing nail-driving
competitions for women, and hat-trimming
competitions for men, in order to replenish a depleted
treasury, I remember what Jesus said about
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>162</a></span>
the sandals. He pleaded with His men not to expose
His Church to contempt. It is better to do things
modestly and preserve the Church's dignity than
to swell her funds and make her an object of derision.
It is better to wear sandals and be respected
than to wear golden slippers and provoke disgust.</p>

<p>Modesty and dignity invariably go together.
Every man who aspires to the Christian ministry
should read every word that Charles Dickens ever
wrote. In the course of that humanizing process
he will then come upon that terrible fourth chapter
of <span class='it'>The Uncommercial Traveller</span>. It is the most
powerful appeal for ministerial modesty in our
literature. Can any man read without a shudder
that revolting description of evangelistic bluster?
And who is he that can read without tenderness
that closing appeal of the novelist to preachers?
He entreats us to remember the twelve poor men
whom Jesus chose, and to model our behavior, our
language, our style, and our choice of illustration
on the exquisite simplicity and charming grace of
the New Testament records.</p>

<p>But we must sound yet a deeper depth. '<span class='it'>Be
shod with sandals!</span>' said the Master. Now sandals
are easily slipped <span class='it'>off</span> and easily slipped <span class='it'>on</span>. And
why should the minister be ready, at a moment's
notice, to bare his feet? The man who has read
his Bible knows. There came to Moses the Vision
of the Burning Bush. 'And the Lord said unto
Moses, I am the God of thy father, the God of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
Draw not nigh hither; <span class='it'>put off thy shoes</span> from off
thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is
holy ground.' And when Moses the servant of the
Lord died, the Vision of the Captain of the Lord's
Host came to Joshua. 'And Joshua fell on his
face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto
him, What saith my Lord unto his servant? And
the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua,
<span class='it'>Loose thy shoe</span> from off thy foot; for the place
whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did
so.' '<span class='it'>Be shod with sandals</span>,' said the Master, so
that, the moment the vision comes, you may be
ready adoringly to welcome it. Nothing in the
ministry is more important than that the minister
should keep in touch with his dreams, with his
visions, with his revelations. The tragedy of the
ministry is reached when we lace up our elaborate
shoes and say good-bye to the place of open vision.
We never expect again to behold the glory. The
ashes are black on the altar of the soul, the altar
on which the sacred fires once blazed. The light
has gone out of the eye and the ring of passion has
forsaken the voice. '<span class='it'>Be shod with sandals!</span>' said
the Master to His men. 'Take no shoes, but be
shod with sandals.' The vision that led you into
the ministry may come again and again and again.
<span class='it'>Be shod with sandals</span> that you may be ready for
the revelation!</p>

<p>Yes, ready for the <span class='it'>Revelation</span> and ready, also,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
for the <span class='it'>Road</span>! For sandals are easily <span class='it'>slipped on</span>.
And the minister must expect the call of the road
at any moment. He must be at home in the silence;
he must be ready for the revelation, but he must
not become a recluse. That was what Longfellow
meant by his <span class='it'>Legend Beautiful</span>. The vision appeared
to the monk in his cell, and he worshipped in
its wondrous presence. Then he remembered the
hungry at the convent gate.</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>Should he slight his radiant guest,</p>
<p class='line0'>Slight his visitant celestial,</p>
<p class='line0'>For a crowd of ragged, bestial</p>
<p class='line0'>Beggars at the convent gate?</p>
<p class='line0'>Would the Vision there remain?</p>
<p class='line0'>Would the Vision come again?</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>A voice within bade him go and feed the hungry
in the road outside,</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>Do thy duty; that is best</p>
<p class='line0'>Leave unto thy Lord the rest.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>He went; and when he returned he found to his
delight that the Vision was still there.</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>Through the long hours intervening,</p>
<p class='line0'>It had waited his return,</p>
<p class='line0'>And he felt his bosom burn,</p>
<p class='line0'>Comprehending all the meaning,</p>
<p class='line0'>When the blessed Vision said:</p>
<p class='line0'>'Hads't thou stayed, I must have fled!'</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>'<span class='it'>Be shod with sandals!</span>' said the Master; so that
at a moment's notice, you may slip them <span class='it'>off</span> to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_165' id='Page_165'>165</a></span>
welcome the vision or slip them <span class='it'>on</span> to take to the
road. The crest of the Baptist Missionary Society
is a picture of an ox between a plough and an altar,
while, underneath the symbols, are the words
'<span class='it'>Ready for Either!</span>' The ox is ready for service
in the field or for sacrifice in the temple. Christ's
minister stands between the glory and the majesty
of things divine on the one hand and all the paths
and the prose of human life on the other. He
must be ready at any moment to enter into fellowship
with the skies; and he must be ready at any
moment to hurry forth to see a sick child, to comfort
a broken-hearted woman or to share the burden
of a man whose load is greater than he can bear.
'<span class='it'>Be shod with sandals</span>'; so that, whether the Revelation
or the Road shall call, you are ready for either.
The ministry is neither mundane nor monastic;
the minister wears sandals that he may keep in
touch with two worlds.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_169' id='Page_169'>169</a></span>I—WE ARE SEVEN!</h1>

<p>Tall, bronzed and bearded, Bruce Sinclair was a
typical New Zealand farmer. He was born in
Fifeshire, it is true, but his parents had emigrated
when he was so young that he seemed to belong
to the land of his adoption. They had come out
on the <span class='it'>John Macintyre</span>—one of the first ships to
bring settlers to these shores. I never saw the
old people. By the time I reached New Zealand,
Bruce had laid them to rest in the little God's-acre
on the crest, and was himself farming the lands
on which they had originally settled. The homestead
was up among the foothills near Otokia—about
nine miles south of Mosgiel—and Bruce
usually rode over on Sundays. One felt that something
was missing, if, on going round to the vestry
door, 'Oscar,' Bruce's chestnut pony, was not to be
seen in the yard. Bruce was quiet and reserved:
he seldom spoke unless he was spoken to: but he
gave an impression of depth and stability. In his
light blue eyes—eyes that seemed paler than they
really were by contrast with his sunburned and
weatherbeaten countenance—there was a subtle
suggestion of secret struggle and secret suffering.
You somehow felt that the calm of his sturdy
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
personality was the peace that comes when mighty
forces have been vanquished, and fierce storms
stilled. I had heard it whispered that in the early
colonial days—the days of his youth—Bruce had
chafed under the restraints of home and had for
some years gone his own way; but except that I
fancied that I saw a look of pain in his face when
he first directed my attention to the framed portraits
of his parents as they hung on either side of the
fireplace at Otokia, he had given me no hint of anything
of the kind.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning I missed the chestnut pony.
During the week Mrs. Sinclair called at the manse
to tell me that Bruce was ill.</p>

<p>'But don't trouble to come,' she said. 'He
couldn't see you even if you did; and it's a long
way to come for nothing. I'll let you know when
he's able to see you.'</p>

<p>True to her word, she at length gave me permission.
But, as it happened, I was just setting
out for a distant part of the colony—a journey
of a thousand miles—and it was nearly a month
before I was able to turn my face towards the farm
at Otokia. But the day to which I had so long
looked forward dawned at last. The dwelling that
served Bruce as a homestead was a plain, white
box-like little cottage, nestling among the hills about
a quarter of a mile back from the road. Seated
at the open window, he had seen me enter the big
gate at the farm-entrance and drive up the track
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>171</a></span>
from the road to the door. Bowed, and leaning
heavily upon two sticks, he came to the doorway
to greet me, a wan smile lighting up a countenance
that seemed strangely pale. I saw at a glance that
he had been very ill.</p>

<p>'But there, I'm better now,' he said, cheerfully,
'and shall soon be all right again. Sit down!'
and he pointed to a lounge-chair on the verandah.</p>

<p>We sat there chatting for awhile, and then Mrs.
Sinclair brought out the afternoon tea. As soon
as the cups had been removed, I rose as if to go.</p>

<p>'Oh, don't be in a hurry!' he said. 'Sit down!
I want to tell you of a strange experience I've had.'
I resumed my seat.</p>

<p>'You see,' he went on, 'I had a birthday—my
fiftieth—just as my illness was at its worst. I had
intended having a few very old friends here to
celebrate the occasion; but that, of course, was out
of the question. The idea had, however, fastened
itself so firmly upon my mind that, in my delirium,
I thought I was sending out the invitations.' He
laughed; but I could see that there was a good deal
of seriousness behind it.</p>

<p>'You know how at such times, things get mixed
up in your brain,' he went on, 'well, my birthday
invitations and the other thoughts that had come
to me in the earlier stages of my sickness got hopelessly
confused. I was in great distress because
I could only think of three people whom I wanted
to invite. I wrote out invitations to <span class='it'>The Man I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_172' id='Page_172'>172</a></span>
Used to Be</span>, <span class='it'>The Man I Might Have Been</span>, and <span class='it'>The
Man I Shall Be</span>. I remember thinking that these
were strange people to ask; and I was surprised
that the number was so small. But the odd part
is to come. For, in the same dream or in another—I
cannot be sure—I thought that I was welcoming
my guests. I had set the table for the four of us—my
three visitors and myself—but, to my amazement,
twice as many people came as I had invited!
I had invited <span class='it'>The Man I Used to Be</span>; but two men
arrived, each of them claiming to be the personage
indicated by that description. Exactly the same
thing happened in the case of <span class='it'>The Man I Might
Have Been</span>, and again in the case of <span class='it'>The Man I
Shall Be</span>. I was at first very bewildered and confused
by the arrival of so many guests; but, excusing
myself, I added three chairs to the number at the
table, making seven in all. Then, when all was
ready, I ushered them in and showed them to their
places. And there we sat—the seven of us.</p>

<p>'The first thing that struck me as I surveyed
the six faces about me was that, although they
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_173' id='Page_173'>173</a></span>
seemed arranged in pairs, no two of the same name
bore much resemblance to each other. The
couples were contrasts rather than duplicates.' Mrs.
Sinclair appeared, bringing her husband's medicine;
he drank it quickly and continued his story.</p>

<p>'I can't help laughing as I think of it now,' he
went on, 'it seems so very fantastic and absurd;
but it was a grimly serious business at the time;
and I am afraid that, considered as a birthday
frolic, it was scarcely a success. There I sat at the
head of the table, my six selves around me. In each
of them I could see something of the features that
I regularly behold in the mirror; but in each case
the general impression was either disfigured or
idealized. Let me describe them two by two.</p>

<p>'To begin with, there was <span class='it'>The Man I Used To
Be</span>—the first of that name. He was my guest,
and I tried to be civil, but in my heart I could not
welcome him. I sat there wondering—you know
how such things happen in dreams—by what strange
impulse I had invited him to my table. For, truth
to tell, I have always dreaded his return. Have
you read Grant Allen's story, <span class='it'>The Reverend John
Creedy</span>? I have it inside there: I will ask Mrs.
Sinclair to bring it out before you go, and you shall
take it with you. I read it a few weeks before my
illness, and it made a great impression upon me.
It is the story of an African boy, taken from the
hold of a slaver on the Gold Coast and carried away
to England. He is committed to a Christian home;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_174' id='Page_174'>174</a></span>
is most carefully trained and educated; and is
denied nothing that can add to his culture and
refinement. He goes to Oxford; becomes a
Bachelor of Arts; is ordained, and is designated to
return as a missionary to his native land. Before
leaving, he marries Miss Ethel Berry, a gently
nurtured English lady; and, amidst the good wishes
of a great host of admiring friends, the two sail
from Southampton for Central Africa. For awhile
all goes well; they are very happy and very useful.
But, amidst the old environment, the old feelings
are stirred. His blood leaps to the sound of the
toms-toms; the native feasts and dances have a
singular fascination for him; he learns to love once
more the native foods and drinks. It is too much
for him; his old self masters his new self. He
abandons the work; leaves his wife to die; tears up
his English clothes; and goes back to savagery.
And to-day—so Grant Allen concludes the story—to-day,
the old half-caste Portuguese rum-dealer
at Butabue, can point out to any English pioneer
who comes up the river, which one, among a crowd
of dilapidated negroes who lie basking in the soft
dust outside his hut, was once the Rev. John Creedy,
B.A., of Magdalen College, Oxford. This story,
so recently read, may have helped to shape my
dream. At any rate, I remember sitting at the
head of the table looking into the face of <span class='it'>The Man
I Used To Be</span>. "It is bad enough," I thought to
myself, "when the old life comes rushing resistlessly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span>
back upon one as it rushed back upon John Creedy,
no bolts or bars being strong enough to keep it out;
but by what folly had I <span class='it'>invited</span> my old self back and
seated him at my table?" I felt, as I gazed into
his face, as though I had committed the unpardonable
sin.</p>

<p>'And there, sitting beside him, was his namesake!
You can imagine no more striking contrast.
For this second edition of <span class='it'>The Man I Used to Be</span>
appeared to be not only a better man than the other,
but a better man than <span class='it'>The Man I Am</span>. I have
never told you much about the past—one does not
make a song of such things—but I can tell you that
it was a wonderful experience when, nearly thirty
years ago, I renounced the old life, entered the
kingdom of heaven, and joined a Christian church.
As I have said, I would not go back to the old life
for anything on earth. And yet, looking back, I
can see that, in those early days, I had a few fine
qualities that are not mine to-day. I love money
more now than I did then. I love comfort more
now than I did then. In those days, wayward as
I was, I would gladly have given the last coin that
I possessed to help a chum. I remember once
drawing every penny of my balance at the savings
bank to get a comrade out of trouble. I would
have faced any discomfort, privation, or even death
itself, in an enterprise in which we fellows were
engaged together. I am afraid that I am now too
smug to be heroic and too self-centred to be really
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
generous. And, strange as it may seem, as I looked
across the table at <span class='it'>The Man I Used To Be</span>—the
second one—I felt heartily ashamed of <span class='it'>The Man I
Am</span>. I was reading in a book of George Eliot's that
there are only two kinds of religious people—the
people who are the better for their religion and
the people who are the worse for it. I am not sure,
I know that, on the whole, I am the better for my
faith; but I know, too, that before my conversion
I had some good points that I have since lost.</p>

<p>'I need not describe my other guests in such
detail. If the contrast between the two who answered
to the name of <span class='it'>The Man I Used To Be</span> was
great, the contrast between the two who described
themselves as <span class='it'>The Man I Might Have Been</span> was
greater still. I was ashamed to admit the first of
them to the house, and I could see that several of
my guests felt extremely uncomfortable in his presence.
This is the man that I should have been to-day
had that radiant experience of nearly thirty
years ago never visited me. I saw, as I gazed into
the repulsive face of this guest, that, had I continued
the career in which, until then, I had delighted,
the heroic qualities of my waywardness
would soon have vanished, and the sordid elements
of that lawless life would have become dominant
and supreme. The chivalry of those early days
would, in time, have died out of my soul, just as it
died out of King Arthur's Court, and the shame
and the squalor would have become more
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_177' id='Page_177'>177</a></span>
pronounced with the years.' Even sitting on the
verandah, Bruce Sinclair shuddered as he recalled
this aspect of his dream.</p>

<p>'The companion picture—the other edition of
<span class='it'>The Man I Might Have Been</span>—was,' he continued,
'as different as different could be. It seemed
ridiculous that they bore the same name. As I
looked upon the <span class='it'>first</span> of this pair I felt thankful that
I am as I am; but, when I turned to the <span class='it'>second</span>, that
feeling completely forsook me. For I saw, as I
gazed into that face—the face on my immediate
left—what I should have been if, jealously retaining
all the magnanimous and open-hearted qualities
of my early days, I had added to them all the graces
and excellences which Christian experience and the
membership of the church have made possible to
me. But I have done neither the one nor the other.
I have lost the high-spirited virtues of my youth,
and, like a man who has been walking among diamonds,
but has been too indolent to pick them up,
I have failed to acquire the ripe devoutness which
these later years should have brought. It seems
strange now, but on the very last Sunday morning
on which I came to church, you were preaching on
<span class='it'>The Additions of Grace</span>: "Add to your faith, virtue:
and to virtue, knowledge." Do you remember?
You were saying that the art of life lies in adding
virtue to virtue as a mason adds tier to tier or as a
tree adds ring to ring. I thought a good deal about
it afterwards, and it may have woven itself into
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_178' id='Page_178'>178</a></span>
my dream. At any rate, I looked into the face
beside me; I saw the man that I should have been
if only I had added to the generous sentiments of
youth the nobler attainments that Christian experience
and service offered me; and it was like
turning from a masterpiece to a daub when I once
more contemplated <span class='it'>The Man I Am</span>.</p>

<p>'The third pair did not present so strong a contrast.
They might easily have passed for brothers,
one of whom had enjoyed greater advantages, and
moved in better society than the other. The first
of those who presented himself as <span class='it'>The Man I
Shall Be</span> strongly resembled, except that he was
older, <span class='it'>The Man I Am</span>. The fact is, I suppose, that,
of late years, I have been content to take life, at
least on its religious side, pretty much as I found
it. I have become complacent, easy-going, readily-satisfied,
willing to follow the drift. There was a
time, twenty years ago or more, when I used to
submit myself to periodical examinations. I tested
myself; tried to ascertain whether or not I was
growing in grace; felt anxious as to whether the
spirit was gaining upon the flesh or the flesh upon
the spirit. But of late years I have taken things
less seriously, and, now that I have time to think
about such matters, I can see that I have settled
down to a condition that is perilously like stagnation.
Going on at the same sluggish rate for a few more
years, I cannot expect that I shall at last differ
essentially—except in age—from <span class='it'>The Man I Am</span>;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_179' id='Page_179'>179</a></span>
and <span class='it'>that</span>, I suppose, is why the <span class='it'>first</span> of these two
seems in some respects to resemble so closely the
man that I see each day in the mirror.</p>

<p>'The <span class='it'>second</span>—the guest on my immediate right—was
a much finer man. He, too, was old; but
there was a grace and a sweetness and a charm
about his age that was quite absent from the person
of his companion. Indeed, but for the association
of ideas suggested by the circumstances under which
we met, I should never have recognized myself
in him. But he has taught me—and I feel that life
has been inestimably enriched by the lesson—that,
if I set myself to recapture the better qualities that
I have lost, and begin diligently to cultivate the
graces that I have neglected, I may yet make something
of life, and stand, not altogether confused and
ashamed, before my Lord at the last.</p>

<p>'I am not sure,' my old friend concluded, 'I am
not sure that all this occurred to me in the course
of my dream. Much of it has probably suggested
itself in my subsequent reflections. In time of
sickness and of convalescence a man sees life from
a new angle. He is able to do a little stocktaking.
And I feel that, in my case, the operation—perhaps
because it was particularly necessary—has been
particularly profitable.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Sinclair came out to ask if he was feeling
chilly. The afternoon sun was certainly sinking;
and I am afraid that I had allowed my friend to
tire himself in telling me his tale. He made an
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_180' id='Page_180'>180</a></span>
excellent recovery, however, and, in the years that
followed, was at church more frequently than ever.
And it may have been a fond illusion of my own,
but somehow I fancied that, as time went on, he
became more and more like that nobler, lovelier,
kindlier self that he had so graphically described
to me.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>181</a></span>II—THE FISH-PENS</h1>

<p>I was holiday-making at Lake King. As a matter
of fact, Lake King is no lake at all. It used to be;
and, like the Church at Sardis, and like so many of
us, it bears the name that it once earned but no
longer deserves. In former days, a picturesque
rampart of sand hummocks, richly draped in native
verdure, intervened between the fresh waters of the
land-locked lake and the heaving tides of the
Southern Ocean. Then the engineers arrived;
and when the engineers take off their coats no man
can tell what is likely to happen next. At Panama
they split a continent in two. At Lake King they
wedded the lake to the ocean. Through the range
of sand-dunes they cut a broad, deep channel by
which the big ships could pass in and out, and, as
an inevitable consequence, Lake King is a lake no
longer. But it was not the big ships that interested
me. It was the trawlers. I liked to see the fishing-boats
come in from the ocean and liberate their
shining spoil at the pens. On the shores of the lake
the fishermen have fenced off a sheet of water, a
quarter of an acre or so in area; and into this
sheltered reserve they discharge their daily catch.
I never tired of visiting the fish-pens. As I looked
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>182</a></span>
down into their clear waters they seemed to be
one moving mass of beautiful fish. Never in my
life had I seen so congested an aquarium. There
were thousands upon thousands, tons upon tons, of
them.</p>

<p>'You should row across in the early morning,'
one of the fishermen was good enough to say. 'You
would see us dragging the pens and filling the boats
with the fish that we were about to pack for the
market.'</p>

<p>I took the hint, and shall never forget the animated
spectacle that I then witnessed. The waters
that had previously seemed so tranquil were a
seething tumult of commotion. The men were
wading up to their thighs dragging the nets through
the crowded pens. Thousands upon thousands of
splendid fish were fighting for dear life, excitedly
darting and flapping and leaping and diving and
splashing in a hopeless attempt to escape the enmeshment
of the enfolding toils. Netful after netful
was emptied into the boats. In half an hour the
boats themselves were filled to the brim with the
poor stiffened creatures from which all life and
beauty had departed.</p>

<p>'And do the fish keep good in the pens for an
indefinite period?' I asked my fisherman friend—the
man who had invited me across.</p>

<p>'Oh, dear, no,' he replied, 'that's the trouble.
If we could keep them here until the market suited
us, we should quickly make our fortunes. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_183' id='Page_183'>183</a></span>
they soon get slack and soft and flabby. The life
in the pens isn't a natural one. They haven't to
work for their living and they are in no danger of
attack. The palings and wire-netting that keep
them in keep their natural enemies <span class='it'>out</span>. In the
ocean they have to be active and vigilant and spry.
But here they lie at their ease; they move to and fro
sluggishly for the mere fun of the thing; and they
soon go to pieces in consequence.'</p>

<p>Away on the Dogger Bank the fishermen cherish
a tradition which, on suitable occasions, they recite
with infinite relish. It belongs to the heroic age
that enfolded land and sea before the day of the
steam-trawler had dawned. In those unhurried
times, the fishing-boats spread their tawny sails,
and, to the accompaniment of chanties and choruses
such as sailors love, crept slowly out to sea. In
sleepy little fishing-villages along the English
coast, you may still see craft of this romantic—and
historic—build. One little hamlet of the sort I
often visit in my dreams. Years ago I knew every
pebble on its beach. Winds and waves have
scooped out a kind of alcove in the massive cliffs.
High up, pressing closely against the rugged wall
of chalk, stands a cluster of weather-beaten cottages.
In front of them the fishing-boats are drawn up.
Nets are spread out on the beach to dry, coils of
rope lie about, and piles of tackle are everywhere.
If you are as fortunate as I should like you to be,
you will see, moving to and fro between his cottage
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_184' id='Page_184'>184</a></span>
and his boat, a tall bronzed figure in a blue jersey
and a sou'wester. He is the most popular fisherman
in the place. He was born here; and, save for two
years of which he does not like to think, has spent
all his days on this beach. Just once he wandered.
He joined the fleet on the Dogger Bank. He worked
on the trawler that raced out and raced round and
raced back. He saw the cutters darting to and fro
between the fleet and the market. And, the more
he saw of this side of life, the less he liked it. He
returned to the quiet little cove among the cliffs.
If, some day, you can catch him in one of his leisure
hours, and in one of his garrulous moods, he may be
beguiled into telling you of the tales he heard told
on the Dogger. For, out there where they fish by
machinery, and use tackle of which the little hamlet
never dreams, the men like to poke fun at the old-fashioned
craft on the beach. And, when they
speak of the old days and the old ways, they remind
each other that, years ago, each fishing-boat was
fitted with a tank or well, constructed with
perforated sides so that the water it contained was
part and parcel of the sea through which the boat
was sailing. Into these wells the fish were transferred
from the nets immediately upon their arrival
from the deep. In this new environment the
graceful creatures gave no evidence of discontent
or resentment. They would live indefinitely in
their floating homes. But the fishermen found that,
like the fish in these Australian pens, the fish in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_185' id='Page_185'>185</a></span>
wells waxed limp and listless. They lost their
flavor and sweetness. This, according to the
tradition, happened to all the fishing-boats save one.</p>

<p>One fisherman, and one only, brought his fish
to market in excellent condition. He landed them
at Billingsgate as healthy and brisk and firm as
though he had caught them ten minutes earlier
under London Bridge. The dealers soon learned to
distinguish between the fish from his boat and the
fish from all the others. His fish brought the
highest prices on the market, and the happy fisherman
rejoiced in his abounding prosperity. His
comrades marvelled at his success and vainly
endeavored to cajole his secret from him. He was
not to be drawn. The matter remained an inscrutable
mystery until the day of the old fisherman's
death. Then, acting upon her father's instructions,
his daughter unfolded the secret. Her
father, she said, made it a rule to keep a catfish in
the well of his boat. The catfish kept the other fish
in a ferment of agitation and alarm. They were
never at rest. And, because a catfish compelled
them to live in the well under conditions that were
approximately normal, they came to market in as
wholesome a state as though they had just been
dragged from the deep.</p>

<p>I often take myself into a quiet corner and remind
myself of my visit to the fish-pens or repeat to
myself the famous tradition of the catfish. I find
myself at times in a rebellious mood. Why is life
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>186</a></span>
so troubled, so agitated, so disturbed? If only I
could be left alone! Why may I not fold my hands
and be quiet? I am hunted up hill and down dale;
I am driven from pillar to post. I have to work
for my living—an irksome necessity. I often have
to go out when I would rather stay in, and have to
stay in when I would rather go out. I am the prey
of antagonisms of many kinds. Life is full of
irritations, annoyances, mortifications, and disappointments.
I am not my own master. Like Paul,
<span class='it'>I find a law that, when I would do good, evil is
present with me; the good that I would I do not and
the evil which I would not that I do</span>. Paul found it
extremely exasperating, and so do I. If only I
could live without work and without worry and
without any of my present vexations! Why, oh
why, must there always be a catfish in my well?</p>

<p>A catfish is an animated compliment. I do not
suppose that a <span class='it'>Dictionary of Oceanography</span> or a
<span class='it'>Cyclopædia of Pisciculture</span> would define a catfish
precisely in that way. But I prefer my own definition
to that of the encyclopædia; it is more brief
and it is quite as accurate. A catfish, I repeat,
is an animated compliment. It is because the
fisherman values his fish that he puts the catfish
into the well to annoy them. 'I remember,' says
Dr. James Stalker, 'I remember hearing a celebrated
naturalist describe a species of jellyfish, which, he
said, lives fixed to a rock from which it never stirs.
It does not require to go in search of food, because
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_187' id='Page_187'>187</a></span>
in the decayed tissues of its own organism there
grows a kind of seaweed on which it subsists. I
thought I had never heard of any creature so comfortable.
But the eminent naturalist who was describing
it went on to say that it is one of the very
lowest forms of animal life, and the extreme comfort
which it enjoys is the badge of its degraded
position.' Now this seems to throw a little light on
my own discontent. No fisherman would take
any pains to preserve such worthless things. When
the fisherman drops the hideous catfish into the
well, it is his way of telling the shiny creatures that
are already there of the high esteem in which he
holds them.</p>

<p>This leads me to Robinson Crusoe. Robinson
Crusoe caught a glimpse of this doctrine of the
catfish, and it dispelled some of his most acute
perplexities. The pity of it is that, later on, when
he found himself confronted by the gravest and
most baffling bewilderment of all, he failed to apply
to it the same vital principle. He saw the law at
work among his <span class='it'>minor</span> difficulties; it did not occur
to him that it might also operate among the <span class='it'>major</span>
ones.</p>

<p>A day came on which Crusoe discovered that
he was not, as he had fancied, the monarch of
all he surveyed. His sovereignty was disputed.
Everybody remembers the haunting passage about
the footprint on the sand. 'It happened one day,
about noon, going towards my boat, I was exceedingly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_188' id='Page_188'>188</a></span>
surprised with the print of a man's foot on
the shore. How it came thither I knew not, nor
could I in the least imagine; but after innumerable
fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly confused
and out of myself, I came home to my fortification,
not feeling, as we say, the ground I trod upon, but
terrified to the last degree, looking behind me at
every two or three steps, mistaking every bush
and tree, and fancying every stump to be a man.
Nor is it possible to describe how many various
shapes my affrighted imagination represented things
to me in, how many wild ideas were found every
moment in my fancy, and what strange, unaccountable
whimseys came into my thoughts by the
way.' Now this story of Crusoe and the cannibals
is simply the story of the cod and the catfish in
another form. The cod would have liked the well
all to itself: it is horrified at discovering that it
must share it with a catfish!</p>

<p>Yet, as we have seen, the cod were the better
for the catfish; and, as Crusoe afterwards recognized,
the island was enriched by the coming of
the cannibals. <span class='it'>Robinson Crusoe</span> is essentially a
story with a moral; and Crusoe leaves you in no
doubt as to the moral. He is most explicit in that
regard. 'For,' he tells us, 'I began to be very
well contented with the life that I was leading, if
only I could have been secured from the dread of
the savages.' How little he thought that, so far
from hurting a single hair of his head, the savages
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_189' id='Page_189'>189</a></span>
would provide him, in the person of his man Friday,
with the most devoted servant and most constant
friend that any man could possibly possess!
'<span class='it'>Wherefore</span>,' he says, in formulating the moral to
be deduced from his sensational experience, '<span class='it'>wherefore
it may not be amiss for all people who shall read
this story of mine to learn from it that very frequently
the evil which we seek most to shun, and
which, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful
to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of our
deliverance, by which alone we can be raised again
from the affliction into which we have fallen</span>.'</p>

<p>Now this was the <span class='it'>minor</span> perplexity; the <span class='it'>major</span>
one came later. And the extraordinary thing is
that, confronted by that larger perplexity, Crusoe's
own maxim does not seem to have recurred to him.
Crusoe has met the cannibals; they have come and
gone; and they have left Friday behind them.
Crusoe has taught Friday to speak English, and is
doing his best to store his mind with the highest
knowledge of all. 'One day,' so runs his narrative,
'I had been teaching him that the devil was God's
enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his malice
and skill to defeat the good designs of Providence,
and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the world.
"Well," replies Friday, in broken English, "but
you say God is so strong, so great; is he not much
strong, much mighty as the devil?" "Yes, yes,
Friday," I replied, "God is stronger than the devil;
God is above the devil, and therefore we pray to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_190' id='Page_190'>190</a></span>
God to tread him down under our feet and enable
us to resist his temptations and quench his fiery
darts." "But," says he again, "if God much
stronger, much mighty as the wicked devil, <span class='it'>why
God no kill the devil</span>, so make him no more do
wicked?" I was strangely surprised at this question;
and, after all, though I was now an old man,
yet I could not tell what to say, so I pretended not
to hear him. But Friday kept repeating his question
in the same broken words: "<span class='it'>Why God no kill
the devil?</span>" I therefore diverted the discourse by
rising up hastily and sending him for something a
long way off.' It was the greatest humiliation that
Robinson Crusoe sustained during his long sojourn
on the island.</p>

<p>'<span class='it'>Why God no kill the devil?</span>' asked Friday. It
sometimes happens that the best way of answering
one question is to ask a few more. Let us try.
'<span class='it'>Why God no kill the devil?</span>' Why did the shrewd
old fisherman not kill the catfish in the well of his
boat? Why did the fish in the pens grow slack
and soft and flabby as soon as the palings and wire-netting
cut them off from the assaults of their
natural enemies? 'In the Louvre,' says Professor
William James, in his <span class='it'>Varieties of Religious Experience</span>,
'in the Louvre there is a picture by Guido Reni
of St. Michael with his foot on Satan's neck. The
richness of the picture is in large part due to the
fiend's figure being there. The richness of its
allegorical meaning also is due to his being there.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_191' id='Page_191'>191</a></span>
The world, that is to say, is <span class='it'>all the richer for having
a devil in it</span>, so long as we keep our foot upon
his neck.'</p>

<p>It is an old story. It is the tree that is buffeted
by the wind that develops the strongest roots and
the sturdiest fibre. It is in the carcase of the lion
with which he fought for his life that Samson finds
the honey. 'I did not learn to preach all at once,'
says Martin Luther, in a delightful burst of confidence.
'It was my temptations and my corruptions
that best prepared me for my pulpit. The
devil has been my best professor of exegetical and
experimental divinity. Before that great schoolmaster
took me in hand, I was a sucking child
and not a grown man. It was my combats with
sin and with Satan that made me a true minister
of the New Testament. It is always a great grace
to me, and to my people, for me to be able to say
to them, "I <span class='it'>know</span> this text to be true! I know it
<span class='it'>for certain</span>!" Without incessant combat and pain
and sweat and blood, no ignorant stripling of a
student ever yet became a powerful preacher.'
That is the lesson that I learned at the fish-pens.
That is the secret that the wise old fisherman, of
catfish fame, bequeathed to his mystified companions.
That is what Robinson Crusoe learned
in the course of his long and lonely exile. And,
in the rough and tumble of common life, there is
scarcely any lesson of greater value to be learned.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_192' id='Page_192'>192</a></span>III—EDGED TOOLS</h1>

<p>I was motoring among the semi-tropical landscapes
of Queensland. We swept past gardens that were
gay with scarlet flame trees, brilliant creepers,
bright-red corals, and bougainvilleas of many
gorgeous hues. Spread out in endless panorama
about us were orange groves, vineyards, sugar
plantations, and fields in which the pineapple, the
banana, the paw-paw, the mango, and the breadfruit
luxuriated. And then we burst into the bush,
which only differed from the bush to which I was
more accustomed in that it was sprinkled with
enormous anthills and dotted with green clumps of
prickly pear.</p>

<p>After several hours spent in this delightful way,
the car unexpectedly stopped, and my host and
hostess prepared to alight. I peered about me for
some explanation of their behavior, but could nowhere
discover one. There was no house to be
seen nor any sign of civilization or of settlement.
My first impulse was to remain in the car with the
driver.</p>

<p>'We are going a little way into the bush,' my
host explained, addressing me; 'if you care to come
with us, we shall be very pleased.'
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_193' id='Page_193'>193</a></span></p>

<p>I joined them instantly, and we were soon out
of sight of the car. We picked our way through
the thick undergrowth for about a quarter of a mile,
then emerged upon a little plot carefully fenced off
from the surrounding wilderness. It was a cemetery
only a few feet square; and it contained three
graves! It was evidently to the central one that
our pilgrimage had been made. My companions
stood in silence for a moment beside it, and then
seated themselves on the grass near by.</p>

<p>'In our early days,' my host explained, 'we
used to live not very far from here. It was a lonely
place and a hard life; and it had joys and sorrows
of its own. The greatest of its joys was the birth
of Don, our firstborn; and the greatest of our sorrows
was his death. He was only five when we
buried him.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' added his wife, brushing a tear from her
eye, 'and we buried him with a broken penknife
in his hand. A swagman who had sheltered for
the night in one of the out-buildings had given it
to him before leaving in the morning, and Don
thought it the most wonderful thing he had ever
possessed. He was working away with it from
morning to night. He would not trust it out of
his sight. He had it in his hand when, a few days
afterwards, he was taken ill. He clung to it all
through his sickness. If he dropped it in his sleep,
he asked for it as soon as he woke. He raved about
it in his delirium. And it was firmly clasped in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_194' id='Page_194'>194</a></span>
his hand when he died. We had not the heart
to take it from him, and so he went down to his
grave still holding it.'</p>

<p>Often since I have thought of that burial in the
bush, not merely because the incident was so touching,
but because it was so intensely characteristic.
A boy's infatuation for his first pocket knife! It
may have a rusty handle and a broken blade; the
edge may be as jagged as the edge of a saw and the
spring may have vanished with the days of long ago;
it makes no difference. With a knife in his hand
a boy feels that he is monarch of all he surveys.
With a knife in his hand he feels himself every
inch a man. A boy's first consciousness of power,
of dominion, of authority comes to him on the day
on which he grasps his first knife. It is by means of
a knife that he carves his way to destiny.</p>

<p>Civilization may be said to have dawned on the
day on which the first man in the world held in his
hand the first knife in the world. It was made of
stone, like the knives of all savage and primitive
peoples. It came into his possession almost by
chance. He was gathering together some huge
stones, and building for himself a wall. Presently
one heavy stone slipped from his hands, fell with
a crash upon another, and broke. But it was not
a clean break. There lay at that first man's feet
two large fragments of stone and a multitude of
splinters. He picked up the largest of the splinters
and found that it had a keen, sharp edge. He cut
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_195' id='Page_195'>195</a></span>
his finger as he stroked it, and the blood crimsoned
the stone. He dropped it as he would have dropped
a snake that had bitten him. But, as he nursed
his smarting hand, he saw the possibilities that the
sharp-edged splinter opened to him. He remembered
the toil with which he had torn down branches
of trees and shaped them to his use. The splinter
would simplify his task. He forgot his lacerated
finger. He seized another stone, dashed it against
its neighbor, and, by repeating the process, soon
secured for himself a more shapely splinter—a
splinter with which he could cut down the branches
less laboriously. He tried it. He laughed as he
found that, armed with the splinter, he could hack
the yielding timber to his will. He was more
excited than he had ever been before. Here was
the first man with his first knife—the pioneer man
with the pioneer knife! For that first man was the
father of men of many colors, and that first knife
was the father of blades of many kinds. From it
sprang the sickle and the scythe, the chisel and the
saw, the spade and the tomahawk, the rapier and
the dagger, the scalpel and the poniard, the razor
and the sword.</p>

<p>The joy that the boy feels as he looks lovingly
on his first knife is the joy of shaping things. The
world about him has suddenly become plastic.
It is a block of marble and he is the sculptor.
He may make of it what he will. Until he possessed
a knife, the hard inanimate substances about him
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_196' id='Page_196'>196</a></span>
defied him. He was the bird and they were the
bars. But now <span class='it'>he</span> defies <span class='it'>them</span>. The knife makes
all the difference. The knife is his sceptre. He is
a king and all things are subject to him.</p>

<p>He may, of course, abuse his power. He probably
will. A boy with a knife is very liable to carve
his name in the polished walnut of the piano or to
cut notches out of the neatly-turned legs of the
dining-room table. From all parts of the world
people go on pilgrimage to Westminster Abbey.
And, at the Abbey, they are shown the Coronation
Chair. Seated in it, all our English sovereigns have
been crowned, and it is encrusted with traditions
that go back to the days of the patriarchs. But a
boy with a knife feels no reverence for antiquity.
On the night of July 5, 1800, a Westminster schoolboy
got locked in the Abbey. He curled himself
up in the Coronation Chair and made it his resting-place
until morning. And, in the morning, he
thought of his pocket-knife. And, as the dawn
came streaming through the storied eastern windows,
he carved deeply into the solid oak of the
seat of the chair, the notable inscription: <span class='it'>P. Abbot
slept in this chair, July 5, 1800.</span> Thus he buried his
blade in one of the noblest of our great historic
treasures. It was enough to make the illustrious
dead, by whom he was everywhere surrounded, turn
in their ancient graves. George the Fourth and all
his successors have since been crowned in a Chair
that bears that impertinent record! Yet, as the chips
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_197' id='Page_197'>197</a></span>
flew, the boy felt no compunction. And, in his
stolid calm, he is the type and representative of all
who abuse the authority with which they are invested.
He feels, as he wields the knife, that all
things are at his mercy; he can shape them to his
liking. He forgets that power carries its attendant
obligations, and that, foremost among those obligations,
is the obligation to restraint. A boy with
a knife in his hand is merely a miniature edition
of a man with a sword in his hand. And a man
with a sword in his hand is often tempted to bury
his blade in that which is even more precious than
the oak of a Coronation Chair. Piano-frames and
table-legs are not the only things that cry aloud
for protection. The greatest lesson that the world
has learned in our time is that the power of the
sword involves its possessor in a responsibility that
is simply frightful. The blood of brave men, the
tears of good women, and the hard-earned wealth of
nations must never be frivolously or lightheartedly
outpoured.</p>

<p>From the moment at which, with sparkling eyes,
that first man seized that first sharp splinter, the
knife has steadily grown upon the imaginations
of men. It took a thousand generations to discover
its potentialities. Indeed, our own generation
is only just beginning to realize the possibilities that
it unfolds. Think of the marvels—I had almost
said the miracles—of modern surgery.</p>

<p>'Let nothing share your heart with your knife!'
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_198' id='Page_198'>198</a></span>
said Dr. Ferguson to Barney Boyle, in <span class='it'>The Doctor
of Crow's Nest</span>. The old doctor had just fallen in
love with Barney. He liked his looks, he liked his
temperament, and he liked his hands.</p>

<p>'You must be a surgeon, Barney! You've got
the fingers and the nerves! A surgeon, sir! That's
the only thing worth while. The physician can't
see further below the skin than any one else. He
guesses and experiments, treats symptoms; tries
one drug and then another. But the knife, my
boy!' The doctor rose and paced the floor in his
enthusiasm. 'The knife, boy! There's no guess
in the knifepoint. The knife lays bare the evil,
fights it, eradicates it! The knife at the proper
moment saves a man's life. A slight incision an
inch or two long, the removal of the diseased part,
a few stitches, and, in a couple of weeks, the
patient's well! Ah, boy, God knows I'd give my
life to be a great surgeon. But he didn't give me
the fingers. Look at these!' and he held up a coarse,
heavy hand. 'I haven't the touch. But you have!
You have the nerve and the fingers and the mechanical
ingenuity; you can be a great surgeon. You
shall have all my time and all my books and all
my money; I'll put you through! You must think,
dream, sleep, eat, drink bones and muscles and
sinews and nerves! Push everything else aside!' he
cried, waving his great hands excitedly. 'And remember!'—here
his voice took a solemn tone—'<span class='it'>let
nothing share your heart with your knife!</span>'
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_199' id='Page_199'>199</a></span></p>

<p>Let nothing share your heart with your knife!
That is always the knife's appeal. It is a plea for
concentration. I was talking to an old gardener the
other day. He was pruning his trees. The gleaming
blade was in his hand and the path was littered
with the wreckage of the branches. He seemed to
be working a shocking havoc, and I told him so.
He laughed.</p>

<p>'Oh, they're well-meaning things, are trees!' he
exclaimed. 'They are anxious to do their best for
you, but they attempt too much, far too much. Just
look at this one!' and he laughed again. 'It thought
it could cover all these branches with roses; and, if
we left it alone, it would try. But what sort of
roses would they be, I should like to know? No,
no, no; it is better for them to produce fewer blossoms
but to produce good ones. We mustn't let
them attempt too much!'</p>

<p>'Let nothing share your heart with your knife!'
said old Dr. Ferguson, as he urged Barney to do
just one thing and to do that one thing well.</p>

<p>'We mustn't let the rose-trees attempt too much,'
said the old gardener, as he lopped off the branches
with his pruning-knife.</p>

<p>That seems to be the lesson that the knife is
always teaching. I remember going one bright
afternoon to see Gregor Fawcett of Mosgiel.
Gregor was passing through a troublous and trying
time. Hard on top of heavy business losses had
come the collapse of his health. To my delight,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_200' id='Page_200'>200</a></span>
however, I found him in a particularly cheerful
mood.</p>

<p>'I've been reading aboot the knife, d'ye ken?' he
explained. 'It's a bonny passage!' He took the
open Bible from the table beside the bed and pointed
me to the fifteenth of John. '<span class='it'>Every branch in Me
that beareth not fruit, he cutteth away; and every
branch that beareth fruit, he pruneth it that it may
bring forth more fruit.</span>'</p>

<p>'It brought me a power o' comfort,' Gregor explained.
'For it says, ye ken, that there are only
two sorts o' wood on the tree—the <span class='it'>dead</span> wood and
the <span class='it'>live</span> wood. He cuts away the <span class='it'>dead</span> wood for
the sake of the live wood that he leaves; and he
cuts the <span class='it'>live</span> wood that bears fruit so that it may
bear still more and still better fruit. Well, I thocht
o' all the losses I've had lately. I dinna ken whether
the things that have been taken were <span class='it'>dead</span> things
or <span class='it'>live</span> things, but it doesna matter. If they were
<span class='it'>dead</span> things, I'm better without them. And, if they
were <span class='it'>live</span> things, they were only cut away because
my life is like a tree that bears fruit and that may
yet bear more. And, in either case, the best
remains. The tree is the richer and not the poorer
for the pruning. The pruning only shows that the
gardener cares. Ay, it's a bonny passage that!'
and Gregor laid the open Bible lovingly on the
pillow beside him. 'After you've gone,' he said, 'I
shall go over it again!'</p>

<p>And, from the frequency with which he quoted
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_201' id='Page_201'>201</a></span>
the words to buffeted spirits in the days that followed,
I could see that, on that further inspection,
Gregor had kissed the husbandman's knife even
more reverently and rapturously than before.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_202' id='Page_202'>202</a></span>IV—OLD PHOTOGRAPHS</h1>

<p>We badly need an Asylum for Antiquated Portraiture—a
pleasant and hospitable refuge in which
all our old photographs could be carefully preserved
and reverently handled. For lack of such an
institution we are all in difficulties. People come
into our lives; we become attached to them and
value their friendship; we exchange photographs;
and, as soon as we have done so, the inevitable
happens. The photographs get hopelessly out of
date. Friends come and go; we come and go; but
the photographs remain. Or, if the friends themselves
abide, they change; fashions change; and, in
a few years, the photographs look singularly archaic
if not positively ridiculous. They go away into a
drawer or a box. Once or twice a year a spring-cleaning
or other volcanic upheaval reminds us of
their existence. 'We must really sort these out and
destroy a lot of them!' we say; but we never do it.
Everybody knows why. It seems a betrayal of old
confidences, an outrage upon sentiment, a heartless
sacrilege. There should be an asylum for obsolete
portraiture, or, if that is out of the question, we
should do with the photographs what Nansen and
Johansen, the Polar explorers, did with their dogs.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_203' id='Page_203'>203</a></span>
Neither had the heart to shoot his own; so, amid
the ice and snow of the far north, they exchanged
their canine companions, and each went sadly and
silently away and shot the other's!</p>

<p>Such a course must, however, be regarded as a
makeshift and a subterfuge. The asylum is the
thing. I am opposed, tooth and nail, to the
destruction of old photographs under any conditions.
I spent an hour yesterday afternoon down by
the lake reading some of the love-letters that Mozart
wrote to his wife nearly two centuries ago. Poor
Johann and poor Stanzerl! They were so pitifully
penniless that when, one bitter winter's morning,
a kindly neighbor fought his way through the deep
snow to see how the young couple were getting
on, he found them dancing a waltz on the bare
boards of their narrow room. They could not
afford a fire, and this was their device for keeping
warm. And now Johann is away on a business
trip. In our time a husband so situated would
send his wife a telegram to say that he had arrived
safely, or, perhaps, buy her a picture-postcard of
the view from his hotel window. But Mozart
wrote the prettiest love-letters. 'Dear little wife,'
he says, 'if I only had a letter from you! If I
were to tell you all that I do with your dear likeness,
how you would laugh! For instance, when I take
it out of its case, I say "God greet thee, Stanzerl,
God greet thee, thou rascal, shuttlecock, pointy-nose,
nicknack, bit and sup!" And, when I put it back,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_204' id='Page_204'>204</a></span>
I let it slip in very slowly, saying, with each little
push, "Now—now—now!" and at the last, quickly—"Good-night,
little mouse, sleep well!"' Where
is that portrait now? I dread to hazard a conjecture!
There was, alas, no asylum to which it
could be fondly and reverently entrusted. Photographs,
like fashions, are capable of strange revivals.
One never knows when crinolines or hobble skirts
will reappear; and in the same way, one never
knows the moment at which some quaint old faded
photograph will acquire new and absorbing interest.</p>

<p>'Why, bless me,' you exclaim, as you lay down
the newspaper, 'here's Charlie Brown become
famous! You remember Charlie; he was the second
son of the Browns who lived opposite us at Kensington!
Why, I have a photograph of him, taken when
he was a little boy; I'll run and get it!' But alas,
it has been destroyed. Or the regret may be even
more poignant.</p>

<p>'Dear me,' you say, 'poor old Mary Smith is
dead!' The announcement brings with it, as such
announcements have a way of doing, a rush of
reminiscence. A simple old soul was Mary Smith.
She was very good to us, five and twenty years ago,
when the children were all small and sicknesses
were frequent. Mary always knew exactly what to
do. But we moved away, and the years went by.
Letter-writing was not in Mary's line. With the
obituary notice still before us, we talk of Mary and
the old days for awhile, and then we suddenly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_205' id='Page_205'>205</a></span>
remember that, when we came away, Mary gave
us her photograph. It was a quaint, old-fashioned
picture; it had been taken some years earlier; but
we were glad to have it, and we put it with the
others. We must slip up and get it! But it, too,
has vanished! Somehow, Mary <span class='it'>living</span> did not seem
quite so pathetic and lovable a figure as Mary <span class='it'>dead</span>.
At some spring-cleaning we must have glanced at
the creased and faded portrait, and, without pausing
to allow memory to do such vivid work as she has
done to-day, we must have tossed it out. We feel
horribly ashamed. If only we could recover the
old photograph we would stand it on the mantelpiece
and do it signal honor. And to think that, in
the confusion of cleaning-up, we threw it out, perhaps
tore it up, perhaps even burned it. We
shudder at the thought, and half hope that, in her
new and larger life, Mary—who seems nearer to us
now than she did before we read of her passing—does
not know that we were guilty of treachery so
base.</p>

<p>Thus there come into our lives moments when
photographs assert their worth and insist on being
appraised at their true value. In the stirring chapter
in which Sir Ernest Shackleton tells of the loss
of his ship among the ice-floes, he describes an
incident that must have set all his readers thinking.
In the grip of the ice, the <span class='it'>Endurance</span> had been
smashed to splinters; and the entire party were out
on a frozen sea at the mercy of the pitiless elements.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_206' id='Page_206'>206</a></span>
Shackleton came to the conclusion that their best
chance of eventually sighting land lay in marching
to the opposite extremity of the floe; at any rate,
it would give them something to do, and there is
always solace in activity. He thereupon ordered
his men to reduce their personal baggage to two
pounds weight each. For the next few hours every
man was busy in sorting out his belongings—the
treasures that he had saved from the ship. It was
a heart-breaking business. Men stole gloomily and
silently away and dug little graves in the snow, to
which they committed books, letters, and various
nicknacks of sentimental value. And, when the
final decisions had to be made, they threw
away their little hoards of golden sovereigns and
kept the photographs of their sweethearts and
wives!</p>

<p>The same perplexity arises, sooner or later, in
relation to the portraits and pictures on our walls.
They become obsolete; but we find it difficult to
order their removal. I had intended, long before
this, devoting an essay to the whole subject of
<span class='it'>Pictures</span>. Why must we smother our walls with
pictures? To begin with, the pattern of the paper
is often a series of pictures in itself, while the dado
and the border simply add to the collection. Then,
over these, we carefully arrange a multitude of
others. Paintings, engravings, and photographs
hang everywhere. Why do we cover the walls in
this way? The answer is that we cover the walls in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_207' id='Page_207'>207</a></span>
order to cover the walls. The walls represent an
imprisonment; the pictures represent an escape. On
the wall in front of me, for example, there hangs a
water-color sketch of Piripiki Gorge, our New
Zealand holiday resort. On a winter's night, when
the rain is lashing against the windows and the wind
shrieking round the house, I glance up at it, and,
by some magic transition, I am roaming on a summer's
evening over the old familiar hills with my
gun in my hand and John Broadbanks by my side.
Through the medium of those landscapes, how
many tireless excursions have I taken, by copse
and beach and riverbank, without so much as rising
from my chair? The photographs hanging here
and there around the room transport my mind to
other days and other places. The apartment in
which I sit may be extremely small, just as the
space that I occupy on the summit of a mountain
may be extremely small. But, occupying that small
space upon that lofty eminence, I command a view
that loses itself in infinity; and, lounging in my
comfortable chair in this little snuggery of mine,
the pictures transform it into an observatory, and
I am able to survey the entire universe. You do not
hang pictures in the cells of a jail; the reason is
obvious; you do not wish the prisoners to escape;
you think it good that they should feel the stern
tyranny of those four uncompromising walls. Conversely,
you deck the dining-room with pictures because,
there, you do <span class='it'>not</span> desire to feel imprisoned;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_208' id='Page_208'>208</a></span>
you do <span class='it'>not</span> wish the walls to seem tyrannical. As
Mr. Stirling Bowen sings:</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>Four walls enclose men, yet how calm they are!</p>
<p class='line2'>They hang up pictures that they may forget</p>
<p class='line0'>What walls are for in part, forget how far</p>
<p class='line2'>They may not run and riotously let</p>
<p class='line0'>Their laughter taunt the never-changing stars.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>In circus cages wolves and tigers pace</p>
<p class='line2'>For ever to and fro. They do not rest,</p>
<p class='line0'>But seek so nervously the longed-for place.</p>
<p class='line2'>Our picture-jungles would not end their quest,</p>
<p class='line0'>Or pictures of another tiger's face.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>On four square walls men have their world, their strife,</p>
<p class='line2'>Their painted, framed endeavors, joys and pain;</p>
<p class='line0'>And two curators known as man and wife</p>
<p class='line2'>Hang up the sunrise, wipe the dust from rain,</p>
<p class='line0'>And gaze excitedly on painted life.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>A picture on the wall is like a window—only
more so! A window looks out on the garden or the
street; a picture is an opening into infinity. The
view from my window is controlled by circumstances.
I cannot, for example, live in this Australian
home of mine and command, from my window,
a view of York Minster, the Bridge of Sighs,
or the Rocky Mountains. And, even if I could,
the darkness of each night would enfold the pleasing
prospect in its sombre and impenetrable veil. But
the pictures do for me what windows could never
do. By means of the pictures I cut holes in the walls
and look out upon any landscape that takes my
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_209' id='Page_209'>209</a></span>
fancy. And, when evening comes, I draw the blinds,
illumine the room from within, and the panorama
that has so delighted me in the day-time
reveals fresh charms in the softer radiance of the
lamps.</p>

<p>We all owe more to pictures than we have ever
yet begun to suspect. Here is a merry young romp
of a schoolboy, of tousle-head and swarthy face;
loving the open-air and hating books like poison.
A lady gives him a ponderous volume, and he turns
away with a sneer. But one day he casually opens
it. There is a colored picture. It represents
Robinson Crusoe and his man Friday in the midst
of one of their most exciting adventures. The boy—George
Borrow—seized the book, carried it off,
and never rested until he had read it from cover to
cover. It opened his eyes to the possibilities of
literature; and, to his dying day, he declared that,
but for that colored print, the world would never
have heard his name or read a line from his pen.
Nor is this all. For it is probable that, in infancy,
our minds receive their first bias towards—or away
from—sacred things from the pictures of biblical
subjects and biblical characters that are then,
wisely or unwisely, exposed to our gaze. The Face
that, in the secret chambers of our hearts, we think
of as the Face of Jesus is, in all likelihood, the Face
that we saw in the first picture-book that mother
showed us.</p>

<p>But I fear that I have wandered. I set out to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_210' id='Page_210'>210</a></span>
talk, not so much about pictures, as about photographs—photographs
in general and old photographs
in particular. Have photographs—and
especially old photographs—no ethical or spiritual
value? Is there a man living who has not, at some
time, felt himself rebuked by eyes that looked down
at him from a frame on the wall? I often feel, in
relation to the photographs around the room, as
Tennyson felt in relation to the spirits of those
whom he had loved long since and lost awhile. It
is lovely to think that those who have passed from
our sight are not, in reality, far from us. And yet—</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>Do we indeed desire the dead</p>
<p class='line2'>Should still be near us at our side?</p>
<p class='line2'>Is there no baseness we would hide?</p>
<p class='line0'>No inner vileness that we dread?</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>Shall he for whose applause I strove,</p>
<p class='line2'>I had such reverence for his blame,</p>
<p class='line2'>See with clear eye some hidden shame</p>
<p class='line0'>And I be lessen'd in his love?</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>Who has not been conscious of a similar feeling
under the searching glances of the eyes upon the
wall? They seem at times to pierce our very souls.
Tennyson came at last to the comfortable assurance
that the shrinking fear with which he thought of
his dead friends was not justified. For, he reflected,
those who have gone out of the dusk into the daylight
have acquired, not only a loftier purity, but a
larger charity.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_211' id='Page_211'>211</a></span></p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>I wrong the grave with fears untrue:</p>
<p class='line2'>Shall love be blamed for want of faith?</p>
<p class='line2'>There must be wisdom with great Death:</p>
<p class='line0'>The dead shall look me thro' and thro'.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>Be near us when we climb or fall:</p>
<p class='line2'>Ye watch, like God, the rolling hours</p>
<p class='line2'>With larger other eyes than ours,</p>
<p class='line0'>To make allowance for us all.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>It is pleasant to transfer that thought to the
photographs around the room. They hang there all
day and every day; they hear all that we say and
see all that we do; those quiet eyes seem to read
us narrowly. Yet if, on the one hand, they see more
in these secret souls of ours to <span class='it'>blame</span>, it is possible
that, on the other, they see more to <span class='it'>pity</span>. The judgements
that we most dread are the judgements of
those who only partly understand. The drunkard
shrinks from the eyes of those who see his
debauchery but know nothing of his temptation.
There is something wonderfully comforting and
strengthening in the clear eyes of those who see,
not a part merely, but the whole.</p>

<p>Charles Simeon, of Cambridge, adorned his study
wall with a fine picture of Henry Martyn. It is
very difficult to say which of the two owed most to
the other. In the days when he was groping after
the light, Henry Martyn—then a student—fell
under the influence of Mr. Simeon, and no other
minister helped him so much. But, later on, when
Henry Martyn was illumining the Orient with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_212' id='Page_212'>212</a></span>
light of the gospel, his magnetic personality and
heroic example exerted a remarkable authority over
the ardent mind of the eminent Cambridge scholar.
Mr. Simeon began to feel that, in some subtle and
inexplicable way, the portrait on the wall was
influencing his whole life. The picture was more
than a picture. A wave of reverential admiration
swept over him whenever he glanced up at it. He
caught himself talking to it, and it seemed to speak
to him. His biographer says that 'Mr. Simeon
used to observe of Martyn's picture, while looking
up at it with affectionate earnestness, as it hung
over his fireplace: "There! see that blessed man!
What an expression of countenance! No one
looks at me as he does! He never takes his eyes
off me, and seems always to be saying: <span class='it'>Be serious!
Be in earnest! Don't trifle! don't trifle!</span>" Then
smiling at the picture and gently bowing, he added:
"<span class='it'>And I won't trifle; I won't trifle!</span>"' His friends
always felt that the photograph over the fireplace
was one of the most profound and effective influences
in the life and work of Charles Simeon; and
nobody who treasures a few reproving and inspiring
pictures of the kind will have the slightest difficulty
in believing it.</p>

<p>The photographs upon my wall are never tyrannical;
else why should I prefer them to the cold,
imprisoning walls? But, though never tyrannical,
they are always authoritative. They speak, not
harshly, but firmly. In the nature of the case, these
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_213' id='Page_213'>213</a></span>
are the faces I revere—the faces of those whom
I have enthroned within my heart. Being enthroned,
they command. They sometimes say <span class='it'>Thou
shalt</span>: they sometimes say <span class='it'>Thou shalt not</span>. They
sometimes suggest; they sometimes prohibit.</p>

<p>And now, before I lay down my pen, shall I
reveal the circumstance that led me to this train
of thought? I am writing at Easter-time. On
Good Friday a lady presented me with an exquisitely
sad but unspeakably beautiful picture—a picture
of the Thorn-crowned Face. Where am I to hang
it? It will insist, tenderly but firmly, on a suitable
and harmonious environment. Henry Drummond
used to tell of a Cambridge undergraduate whose
sweetheart visited his room. She found its walls
covered with pictures of actresses and racehorses.
She said nothing, but, on his birthday, presented
him with a picture like this. A year later she again
called on him at Cambridge. The Thorn-crowned
Face hung over the fireplace; and the other walls
were adorned with charming landscapes and reproductions
of famous paintings. He caught her
glancing at her gift.</p>

<p>'It's made a great difference to the room,' he said;
'what's more, it's made a great difference <span class='it'>in me</span>!'</p>

<p>That is a way our pictures have. They insist on
ruling everything and everybody. I have no right
to enthrone a despot in my home; nor to exalt a
Thorn-crowned King unless I am prepared to make
Him Lord of all.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_214' id='Page_214'>214</a></span>V—A BOX OF BLOCKS</h1>

<h2>I</h2>

<p>We had a birthday at our house to-day, and among
the presents was a beautiful box of blocks. Each
block represented one of the letters of the alphabet.
As I saw them being arranged and rearranged upon
the table, I fell a-thinking. For the alphabet has,
in our time, come to its own. We go through life
muttering an interminable and incomprehensible
jargon of initials. We tack initials on to our
names—fore and aft—and we like to see every one
of them in its place. As soon as I open my eyes
in the morning, the postman hands me a medley of
circulars, postcards and letters. One of them bids
me attend the annual meeting of the S.P.C.A.;
another reminds me of the monthly committee meeting
of the M.C.M.; a third asks me to deliver an
address at the P.S.A. In the afternoon I rush from
an appointment at the Y.M.C.A. to speak on behalf
of the W.C.T.U.; and then, having dropped in to
pay my insurance premium at the A.M.P., I take
the tram at the G.P.O., and ask the conductor to
drop me at the A.B.C. I have accepted an invitation
to a pleasant little function there—an invitation
that is clearly marked R.S.V.P. And so on.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_215' id='Page_215'>215</a></span>
There is no end to it. Life may be defined as a
small amount of activity entirely surrounded by
the letters of the alphabet.</p>

<p>Now the alphabet has a symbolism of its own.
The man who coined the phrase '<span class='it'>as simple as A.B.C.</span>'
went mad; he went mad before he coined it. There
are, it is true, a few simplicities sprinkled among
the intricacies of this old world of ours; but the
alphabet is not one of them. I protest that it is
most unfair to call the alphabet simple. Nobody
likes to be thought simple nowadays; see how
frantically we preachers struggle to avoid any
suspicion of the kind! Any man living would
rather be called a sinner—or even a saint—than a
simpleton. Why, then, affront the alphabet, which,
as we have seen, is working a prodigious amount of
overtime in our service, by applying to it so very
opprobrious an epithet?</p>

<p>'<span class='it'>As simple as A.B.C.</span>,' indeed! Macaulay's
schoolboy may not have been as omniscient as the
historian would lead us to believe, but he at least
knew that there is nothing simple about the A.B.C.
The alphabet is the hardest lesson that a child is
called upon to learn. Latin roots, algebraic equations,
and the <span class='it'>Pons Asinorum</span> are mere nothings
in comparison. Grown-ups have short memories.
They forget the stupendous difficulties that they
surmounted in their earliest infancy; and their forgetfulness
renders them pitiless and unsympathetic.
Few of us recognize the strain in which a child's
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_216' id='Page_216'>216</a></span>
brain is involved when, for the first time, he confronts
the alphabet. The whole thing is so arbitrary;
there is no clue. In his noble essay on <span class='it'>The
Evolution of Language</span>, Professor Henry Drummond
shows that the alphabet is really a picture-gallery.
'First,' he says, 'there was the onomatopoetic
writing, the ideograph, the imitation of the
actual object. This is the form we find in the
Egyptian hieroglyphic. For a man a man is drawn,
for a camel a camel, for a hut a hut. Then, to save
time, the objects were drawn in shorthand—a couple
of dashes for the limbs and one across, as in the
Chinese, for a man; a square in the same language
for a field; two strokes at an obtuse angle, suggesting
the roof, for a house. To express further
qualities, these abbreviated pictures were next compounded
in ingenious ways. A man and a field together
conveyed the idea of wealth; a roof and a
woman represented home; and so on. And thus,
little by little, our letters were evolved. But the
pictures have become so truncated, abbreviated and
emasculated, in the course of this evolutionary
process, that a child, though notoriously fond of
pictures, sees nothing fascinating in the letters of
the alphabet. There is absolutely nothing about the
first to suggest the sound A; nothing about the
second to suggest the sound B. The whole thing
is so incomprehensible; how can he ever hope to
master it? An adult brain, introduced to such a
conglomeration for the first time, would reel and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_217' id='Page_217'>217</a></span>
stagger; is it any wonder that these childish cheeks
get flushed or that the curly head turns at times
very feverishly upon the pillow?</p>

<p>The sequence, too, is as baffling as the symbols.
There is every reason why <span class='it'>two</span> should come between
<span class='it'>one</span> and <span class='it'>three</span>; and that reason is so obvious that the
tiniest tot in the class can appreciate it. But why
must B come between A and C? There is no
natural advance, as in the case of the numerals.
The letter B is not a little more than the letter A,
nor a little less than the letter C. Except through
the operation of the law of association, which only
weaves its spell with the passing of the years, there
is nothing about A to suggest B, and nothing about
B to suggest C. The combination is a rope of sand.
Robert Moffat only realized the insuperable character
of this difficulty when he attempted to teach
the natives of Bechuanaland the English alphabet.
Each of his dusky pupils brought to the task an
observation that had been trained in the wilds, a
brain that had been developed by the years, and
an intelligence that had been matured by experience.
They were not babies. Yet the alphabet proved
too much for them. Why should A be A? and why
should B be B? and why should the one follow the
other? Mr. Moffat was on the point of abandoning
his educational enterprise as hopeless, when one
thick-lipped and woolly-headed genius suggested
that he should teach them to sing it! At first blush
the notion seemed preposterous. There are some
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_218' id='Page_218'>218</a></span>
things which, like Magna Charta and minute-books,
cannot be set to music. Robert Moffat, however,
was a Scotsman. The tune most familiar to his
childhood came singing itself over and over in his
brain; by the most freakish and fantastic conjunction
of ideas it associated itself with the problem
that was baffling him; and, before that day's sun had
set, he had his Bechuana pupils roaring the alphabet
to the tune of <span class='it'>Auld Lang Syne</span>!</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>So A B C</p>
<p class='line0'>D E F G</p>
<p class='line2'>H I J K L M</p>
<p class='line0'>N O P Q</p>
<p class='line0'>R S T U</p>
<p class='line2'>V W X Y Z.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>The rhyme and metre fitted perfectly. The
natives were so delighted that they strolled about
the village shouting the new song at the tops of
their voices; and Mr. Moffat declares that daylight
was stealing through his bedroom window before
the weird unearthly yells at last subsided. I have
often wondered whether, in a more civilized environment,
any attempt has been made to impress
the letters upon the mind in the same way.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>The symbolism of the alphabet rises to a sudden
grandeur, however, when it is enlisted in the service
of revelation. Long, long ago a startled shepherd
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_219' id='Page_219'>219</a></span>
was ordered to visit the court of the mightiest of
earthly potentates, and to address him on matters
of state in the name of the Most High. '<span class='it'>And the
Lord said unto Moses, Come now, therefore, and I
will send thee unto Pharaoh, and I will send thee
also unto the children of Israel. And Moses said
unto God, Behold, when I am come unto them and
shall say, The God of your fathers hath sent me
unto you, and they shall say What is His name?
what shall I say unto them? And God said unto
Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of
Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you!</span>'</p>

<p>'<span class='it'>I am——!</span>'</p>

<p>'<span class='it'>I am</span>—what?'</p>

<p>For centuries and centuries that question stood
unanswered; that sentence remained incomplete.
It was a magnificent fragment. It stood like a
monument that the sculptor had never lived to
finish; like a poem that the poet, dying with his
music in him, had left with its closing stanzas unsung.
But the sculptor of <span class='it'>that</span> fragment was not
dead; the singer of <span class='it'>that</span> song had not perished. For,
behold, He liveth for evermore! And, in the fullness
of time, He reappeared and filled in the gap
that had so long stood blank.</p>

<p>'<span class='it'>I am——!</span>'</p>

<p>'<span class='it'>I am</span>—what?'</p>

<p>'I am—<span class='it'>the Bread of Life</span>!' 'I am—<span class='it'>the Light of
the World</span>!' 'I am—<span class='it'>the Door</span>!' 'I am—<span class='it'>the True
Vine</span>!' 'I am—<span class='it'>the Good Shepherd</span>!' 'I am—<span class='it'>the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_220' id='Page_220'>220</a></span>
Way, the Truth, and the Life</span>!' 'I am—<span class='it'>the Resurrection
and the Life</span>!'</p>

<p>And when I come to the end of the Bible, to the
last book of all, I find the series supplemented and
completed.</p>

<p>'I am—<span class='it'>Alpha and Omega</span>!' 'I am—<span class='it'>A and Z</span>!'
'I am—<span class='it'>the Alphabet</span>!' The symbolism of which I
have spoken can rise to no greater height than that.
What, I wonder, can such symbolism symbolize?
I take these birthday blocks that came to our house
to-day and strew the letters on my study floor. So
far as any spiritual significance is concerned, they
seem as dead as the dry bones in Ezekiel's Valley.
And yet—'<span class='it'>I am the Alphabet</span>!' 'Come,' I cry, with
the prophet of the captivity, 'come from the <span class='it'>Four
Winds</span>, O Breath, and breathe upon these slain that
they may live!' And the prayer has scarcely escaped
my lips when lo, all the letters of the alphabet shine
with a wondrous lustre and glow with a profound
significance.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>For see, the <span class='it'>North Wind</span> breathes upon these
letters on the floor, and I see at once that they are
symbols of the '<span class='it'>Inexhaustibility of Jesus!</span>' '<span class='it'>I am
Alpha and Omega!</span>' '<span class='it'>I am the Alphabet!</span>' I have
sometimes stood in one of our great public libraries.
I have surveyed with astonishment the serried
ranks of English literature. I have looked up,
and, in tier above tier, gallery above gallery, shelf
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_221' id='Page_221'>221</a></span>
above shelf, the books climbed to the very roof,
while, looking before me and behind me, they
stretched as far as I could see. The catalogue containing
the bare names of the books ran into several
volumes. And yet the whole of this literature consists
of these twenty-six letters on the floor arranged
and rearranged in kaleidoscopic variety of juxtaposition.
Which, I ask myself, is the greater—the
literature or the alphabet? And I see at once
that the alphabet is the greater because it is so inexhaustible.
Literature is in its infancy. We shall
produce greater poets than Shakespeare, greater
novelists than Dickens, greater philosophers, historians
and humorists than any who have yet
written. But they will draw upon the alphabet for
every letter of every syllable of every word that they
write. They may multiply our literature a million-million-fold;
yet the alphabet will be as far from
exhaustion when the last page is finished as it was
before the first writer seized a pen.</p>

<p>'<span class='it'>I am—the Alphabet!</span>' He says. He means that
He cannot be exhausted.</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>For the love of God is broader</p>
<p class='line2'>Than the measure of Man's mind;</p>
<p class='line0'>And the heart of the Eternal</p>
<p class='line2'>Is most wonderfully kind.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>The ages may draw upon His grace; the men of
every nation and kindred and people and tongue—a
multitude that no statistician can number—may
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_222' id='Page_222'>222</a></span>
kneel in contrition at His feet; His love is as great
as His power and knows neither measure nor end.
He is inexhaustible.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p>And when the <span class='it'>South Wind</span> breathes upon these
letters on the floor, I see at once that they are
symbols of the <span class='it'>Indispensability of Jesus</span>. Literature,
with all its hoarded wealth, is as inaccessible
as the diamonds of the moon until I have mastered
the alphabet. The alphabet is the golden key that
unlocks to me all its treasures of knowledge, poetry
and romance.</p>

<p>'<span class='it'>I am—the Alphabet!</span>' He says; and He says it
three separate times. For the words occur thrice in
the Apocalypse. In the <span class='it'>first</span> case they refer to the
unfolding of the divine revelation; in the <span class='it'>second</span>
they refer to the interpretation of historic experience;
and in the <span class='it'>third</span> they refer to the unveiled
drama of the future. As the disciples discovered
on the road to Emmaus, I cannot understand my
Bible unless I take Him as being the key to it all;
I cannot understand the processes of historical development
until I have given Him the central place;
I cannot anticipate with equanimity the unfoldings
of the days to come until I have seen the keys of
the eternities swinging at His girdle.</p>

<p>The alphabet is, essentially, an individual affair.
In order to read a single sentence, I must learn it
<span class='it'>for myself</span>. My father's intimacy with the alphabet
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_223' id='Page_223'>223</a></span>
does not help me to enjoy the volumes on my shelves.
The alphabet is indispensable <span class='it'>to me</span>; and so is He!
There is something very pathetic and very instructive
about the story that Legh Richmond tells of
<span class='it'>The Young Cottager</span>. 'The rays of the morning
star,' Mr. Richmond says, 'were not so beautiful in
my sight as the spiritual lustre of this young Christian's
character.' She was very ill when he visited
her for the last time. 'There was animation in her
look—there was more—something like a foretaste
of heaven seemed to be felt, and gave an inexpressible
character of spiritual beauty even in death.'</p>

<p>'Where is your hope, my child?' Mr. Richmond
asked, in the course of that last conversation.</p>

<p>'Lifting up her finger,' he says, 'she pointed to
heaven, and then directed the same finger downward
to her own heart, saying successively as she
did so, "<span class='it'>Christ there!</span>" and "<span class='it'>Christ here!</span>" These
words, accompanied by the action, spoke her meaning
more solemnly than can easily be conceived.'</p>

<p>In life and in death He is our one indispensability.
In relation to this world, and in relation to the
world that is to come, He stands to the soul as the
alphabet stands in relation to literature.</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p>And when the East Wind breathes upon these
letters on the floor, I see at once that they are
symbols of the <span class='it'>Invincibility of Jesus</span>. '<span class='it'>I am—A
and Z!</span>' He is at the beginning, that is to say,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_224' id='Page_224'>224</a></span>
and He goes right through to the end. There is
nothing in the alphabet before A; there is nothing
after Z. However far back your evolutionary
interpretation of the universe may place the beginning
of things, you will find Him there. However
remote your interpretation of prophecy may make
the end of things, you will find Him there. He goes
right through. The story of the ages—past, present
and future—may be told in a sentence: 'Christ first,
Christ last, and nought between but Christ.' Having
begun, He completes. He is the Author and
Finisher of our faith. He sets His face like a flint.
Nothing daunts, deters, or dismays Him. 'I am confident,'
Paul says, 'of this very thing, that He which
hath begun a good work in you will perform it unto
the end.' He never halts at H or L or P or X; he
goes right through to Z. He never gives up.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p>But the greatest comfort of all comes to me on
the Wings of the <span class='it'>West</span> Wind. For, when the West
Wind breathes upon these letters on the floor, I see
at once that they are symbols of the <span class='it'>Adaptability
of Jesus</span>. The lover takes these twenty-six letters
and makes them the vehicle for the expression of
his passion; the poet transforms them into a song
that shall be sung for centuries; the judge turns
them into a sentence of death. In the hands of
each they mold themselves to his necessity. The
alphabet is the most fluid, the most accommodating,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_225' id='Page_225'>225</a></span>
the most plastic, the most adaptable contrivance on
the planet. Just because, in common with every
man breathing, I possess a distinctive individuality,
I sometimes feel as no man ever felt before, and I
express myself in language such as no man ever
used. And the beauty of the alphabet is that it
adapts itself to my individual need. And that is
precisely the beauty of Jesus. '<span class='it'>I am—the Alphabet!</span>'
I may not have sinned more than others; but
I have sinned differently. The experiences of others
never sound convincing; they do not quite reflect my
case. But, like the alphabet, He adapts Himself to
<span class='it'>every</span> case. He is the very Saviour I need.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_226' id='Page_226'>226</a></span>VI—PIECRUST</h1>

<h2>I</h2>

<p>'What do you say to a day or two together at the
Nuggets?' asked John Broadbanks one summer's
evening. I was just returning from a long round
of visitation among the outlying farms, and, driving
into Mosgiel in the dusk, met him on his way home
to Silverstream. We reined up for a moment to
exchange greetings, and he made the suggestion I
have just recorded. The prospect was certainly
very alluring. We had neither of us been away for
some time. There is no wilder or more romantic
bit of scenery on the New Zealand coast; and a
visit to the stately old lighthouse, perched on its
rugged and precipitous cliffs, was always a delightful
and bracing experience.</p>

<p>'We will drive down,' he continued, seeing by my
hesitation that any resistance on my part would
be extremely feeble. 'Sidwell of Balclutha has often
urged us to spend a night at his manse. We will
break our journey there. We can slip our guns
into the spring-cart, and the driving and the shooting
will be half the fun of the frolic. And we may
have time to explore the coast a bit. I should like
to see the reef on which the <span class='it'>Queen of the Amazons</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_227' id='Page_227'>227</a></span>
was wrecked last week, and, if we are lucky enough
to strike a low tide, we may be able to scramble on
board. Are you on?'</p>

<p>He found me very pliable, as, on such occasions,
he usually did; and we spent a memorable week together.
On the Sunday, there being no service
at the Nuggets, we walked along the wet sands to
Port Molyneux, and joined a little group of settlers
who met for worship in the schoolhouse. We rested
on the beach during the afternoon, and, in the evening,
set out to walk to the lighthouse. It was a
glorious moonlight night; we could see the rabbits
scurrying across the road half a mile ahead. When
we reached the crest of that bold promontory on the
extremity of which the lighthouse stands, we found
ourselves surveying a new stretch of coast. The
cliffs at our feet were almost perpendicular, and, far
below us, the wild waves breaking madly over her,
lay all that was left of the <span class='it'>Queen of the Amazons</span>.
We spread out a coat on the edge of the cliff, and
sat for some time in silent contemplation of this
weird and romantic spectacle.</p>

<p>'Well,' I said at last, 'and how did you enjoy the
service this morning?'</p>

<p>The moon was shining full upon his face, and I
could see at a glance that he was reluctant to reply.</p>

<p>'I was afraid you would ask me that,' he said
at length. 'Well, frankly, I was disappointed. It
may have been because I was in a holiday mood, or
perhaps our long walk on such a lovely morning
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_228' id='Page_228'>228</a></span>
had unfitted me for thinking on the sadder side of
things; but, however that may be, I found the service
depressing. It checked the gaiety of my spirit
and deadened the exhilaration which I took to it.
I went in singing; I came out sighing. I felt somehow,
that the preaching was <span class='it'>mostly piecrust</span>.
Obviously, the fellow was not well, and he allowed
his dyspepsia to darken his doctrine. Indigestion
was never intended to be an infectious disease; but
he made it so by sending us all away suffering
from the after-effects of his unwholesome breakfast.
I usually jot down a preacher's heads or divisions,
but I didn't trouble to make a note of his. It was,
firstly, <span class='it'>piecrust</span>; and, secondly, <span class='it'>piecrust</span>; and, thirdly,
<span class='it'>piecrust</span>; and <span class='it'>piecrust</span> all the way through!'</p>

<p>John was not usually a caustic critic. He saw
the best in most of us and magnified it. His outburst
that night on the cliff was therefore the more
startling and the more memorable. I have quite
forgotten what the preacher said at Port Molyneux
in the morning; but, as long as I live, I shall remember
what John said as we sat in the silvery moonlight
that summer's evening, looking down at the great
ship being torn to pieces by the waves on the cruel
reef just below.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>'Why, bless me,' I heard a man exclaim yesterday
in the course of an animated discussion at the
street corner, 'if things go on like this, I shan't
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_229' id='Page_229'>229</a></span>
have a soul to call my own!' As though any man
had! No man living has a soul to call his own,
or a stomach to call his own. The preacher at Port
Molyneux assumed, as he sat at breakfast, that his
digestive organs were his own property, and poor
John Broadbanks and I, as well as all the other
members of the school-house congregation, were
penalized in consequence. Carlyle used to argue,
more or less seriously, that the whole course of
human history has been repeatedly deflected by
blunders of this kind. The world has never known
a more decisive battle than the battle of Waterloo;
but why did the Duke of Wellington win it? All
authorities agree that Napoleon was the greater
general. Lord Roberts declares that the schemes of
Napoleon were more comprehensive, his genius more
dazzling, and his imagination more vivid than
Wellington's. Yet on that fateful day that decided
the destinies of Europe, Napoleon descended to
absolute mediocrity while Wellington rose to surpassing
brilliance. The Emperor was never so
agitated; the Duke was never so calm. Napoleon,
with all the chances in his favor, perpetrated blunder
after blunder; the Duke seemed omniscient and infallible.
Why? Carlyle used to say that Napoleon
threw his brain out of action by eating a hearty
breakfast of fried potatoes. In one respect, at any
rate, Carlyle knew what he was talking about. 'As
a student,' he says, 'I discovered that I was the
owner of a diabolical arrangement called a stomach;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_230' id='Page_230'>230</a></span>
and I have never been free from the knowledge from
that hour to this; and I suppose I never shall until
I am laid away in my grave.' Warned, however,
by the melancholy fate which he believed Napoleon
to have suffered, he guarded against any overflow
of his distress. His readers rarely suffer from the
after-effects of his indiscreet breakfasts. We read
<span class='it'>Sartor Resartus</span>, <span class='it'>Heroes and Hero-worship</span>, and
<span class='it'>Past and Present</span>, and never once think of piecrust
or of fried potatoes.</p>

<p>It is true, I dare say, that all the people in the
school-house were not affected as John Broadbanks
was. Indeed, I heard next day of one lady who
thought the sermon very affecting. It nearly
made her cry, she said; and she felt sure that the
preacher was not long for this world. I would not
on any consideration deprive this excellent creature
of her lachrymal felicity; but if her well-meant
encomiums reached the preacher's ears, I hope he did
not take them too seriously. Lots of people are
fond of piecrust, but it does not follow that it is
good for them. The sort of sermon that would
have stimulated the faith of John Broadbanks might
not have brought tears to the eyes of the lady who
was moved to such a compassionate ecstasy, but it
might have been better for her in the long run. John
Broadbanks found the piecrust sermon depressing;
yet, to a certain type of mind, few things are more
attractive than sadness. We all remember Macaulay's
observations on the inordinate popularity
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_231' id='Page_231'>231</a></span>
of Byron. 'It is,' he says, 'without a parallel in history.
To people who are unacquainted with real
calamity, nothing is so dainty and sweet as lovely
melancholy.' And he goes on to apply this to the
pessimism of Byron. 'People bought pictures of
him; they treasured up the smallest relics of him;
they learned his poems by heart; they did their
best to write like him and to look like him. Many of
them practised in the glass in the hope of catching
the curl of the upper lip and the scowl of the brow
which appear in his portraits. The number of hopeful
undergraduates and medical students who became
things of dark imaginings, on whom the freshness
of the heart ceased to fall like dew, and to
whom the relief of tears was denied, passes all calculation.'
Clearly, this is the lady with the tears—indefinitely
multiplied.</p>

<p>Now, by way of contrast, turn for a moment from
Byron to Browning. Professor Phelps of Yale
says that Browning was too healthy to be popular.
He was robust and vigorous, and therefore optimistic.
But he is slowly winning his way. His
star waxes as Byron's wanes. People find sooner
or later that they cannot live for ever on piecrust.
Mr. Chesterton says that the bravest thing about
Robert Louis Stevenson is that he never allowed
his manuscripts to smell of his medicines. The tortures
that racked his frame never passed down his
pen to the paper spread out before him. You read
his sprightly and stirring romances; you live for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_232' id='Page_232'>232</a></span>
time being among pirates and smugglers and
corsairs; you catch the breath of the hills and the
tang of the sea; and it never occurs to you that you
are the guest of a man who is terribly ill. You hear
him laugh; you never hear him cough. You do not
see his sunken eyes, his hectic cheek, his spectral
form supported by a pile of pillows. You reflect
with astonishment when you lay aside the book that
the story was written by a creature so pitifully frail
that, on all the earth's broad surface, he could only
find one outlandish spot—a lonely hilltop in the
Pacific—in which he could contrive to breathe. By
this time we may hope that our preacher at Port
Molyneux has read the <span class='it'>Life of Stevenson</span>. And,
as he did so, he must have resolved that, however
excruciating his dyspepsia, his congregation, at
least, shall never be infected by it.</p>

<p>I regret now that I did not ask the preacher's
name. If only I knew his address, I should find
pleasure in posting him a copy of <span class='it'>The Autocrat of
the Breakfast Table</span>. For the autocrat knew something
about piecrust. The pie at the boarding-house
looked one day particularly attractive, and
things happened in consequence. 'I took more of it
than was good for me,' says the Autocrat, 'and had
an indigestion in consequence. While I was suffering
from it, I wrote some sadly desponding poems,
and a theological essay which took a very melancholy
view of creation. When I got better, I
labelled them all <span class='it'>Piecrust</span>, and laid them by as scarecrows
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_233' id='Page_233'>233</a></span>
and solemn warnings. I have a number of
books on my shelves that I should like to label with
some such title; but, as they have great names on
their title-pages—Doctors of Divinity, some of them—it
wouldn't do!' I should have been tempted to
mark this passage before posting the book to Port
Molyneux.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>But the really extraordinary thing about piecrust
is that the quality with which it is most frequently
taunted is its one redeeming feature, the
feature that makes it sublime. Promises, they say,
are like piecrust, <span class='it'>made to be broken</span>. Why, the most
beautiful and sacred things in life are made to be
broken! Upon all ordinary things, breakage comes
as the climax of disaster; upon a select few,
breakage comes as the climax of destiny. The
fountain-pen that I hold in my hand—the pen with
which, without so much as a change of nib, all my
books have been written—will lie broken before me
one of these days. It was made; it will be broken;
but it was not made to be broken. The enjoyment
ends with the breakage. But with those other things,
the things of the pie-crust class, the enjoyment begins
with the breakage. When I was a small boy, I
indulged in bird-nesting. And I never looked upon
a cluster of delicately-tinted, prettily-speckled eggs
without feeling that each egg was the most consummate
piece of workmanship that I had ever seen.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_234' id='Page_234'>234</a></span>
Its shape, its color and its pattern were alike perfect.
Indeed, I silenced my conscience as I bore the nest
home by amplifying this very argument. 'If I leave
the nest in the tree,' I said to myself, 'these pretty
things will all be broken! When the birds are
hatched, the eggs will be smashed! They are far
too pretty for that! I will take them home and
keep them. I am really saving them by stealing
them!' I know now that I was wrong. My argument
was made up of casuistry and special pleading.
In reality I destroyed the eggs by preserving them.
They were made to be broken, and I cheated destiny
by preventing the breakage. I have travelled a good
many miles since then; but, every step of the way, I
have learned, in some new form, the same great lesson.
And when, with reverent footsteps, I have
climbed the loftiest summits of all, the truth that I
first discovered in the English hedgerows has become
most radiantly clear. The two greatest events
in the history of this planet are the Incarnation and
the Crucifixion.</p>

<p>It is <span class='it'>Christmas-time</span>; and we think with wonder
and awe of the mystery of that holy body's making!</p>

<p>It is <span class='it'>Easter-time</span>; and we think with wonder and
awe of the mystery of that holy body's breaking!</p>

<p>It is <span class='it'>Communion-time</span>! 'This is My body which
is broken for you,' He said.</p>

<p>And in the making of that body and the breaking
of that body—the body that was made to be broken—a
lost world has found salvation.</p>

<h1><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_235' id='Page_235'>235</a></span>VII—ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL</h1>

<p>It was a cruel winter's night; an icy wind was
howling across the Plain; a glorious fire was blazing
in the dining-room grate; and, happily, I had no
engagements. To add to our felicity, the San
Francisco mail had arrived that morning, bringing
our monthly budget of news from home. The
letters had, of course, been devoured upon delivery,
but the papers and magazines had been laid aside for
evening consumption. We had just opened the
packages and arranged the journals in order of publication
when there came a ring at the front-door
bell. We glanced at each other meaningly and at
the papers regretfully. All kinds of visions presented
themselves; visions of a garrulous visitor
who, with business over, would not go; visions of a
long drive across the Plain in the biting wind;
visions of everything but an evening with each other,
a roaring fire and the English mail. As though to
rebuke our inhospitable and ungracious thoughts,
however, it was only Elsie Hammond. Elsie often
dropped in of an evening; she usually brought her
fancy-work; and, in her presence, we were perfectly
at our ease. Every manse has one or two such
visitors. We read, worked, or chatted when Elsie
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_236' id='Page_236'>236</a></span>
came just as we should have done if she had not
dropped in.</p>

<p>'Why, Elsie,' I exclaimed, as soon as, divested
of her hat and cloak, she entered the dining-room
and took her usual chair, 'whatever brings you out
on a wild night like this?'</p>

<p>'Well,' she replied, 'I wanted to see you about
the Young People's Missionary Union. You remember
that they made me Secretary last month,
and we are arranging for the annual meeting. We
have invited Mr. Harriford Johnson, of the North
Africa Evangelization Society, to give an address;
and I received his reply this morning. He will be
coming out from town by the five-twenty train; and
I wondered if you could let him come to the manse
to tea, and, if needs be, stay the night.'</p>

<p>I put Elsie at her ease by telling her that she
might leave the matter of Mr. Johnson's reception
and entertainment entirely in my hands; and then,
resuming the pile of papers, we had a royal evening
with the English news.</p>

<p>The day of the missionary meeting arrived; and,
as the clock struck five, I set out for the station.
Quite a number of people were moving in the same
direction, among them the Rev. J. M. McKerrow,
my Presbyterian neighbor. We walked towards the
station together. On the platform, however, he
recognized a lady friend from a distance; he moved
away to speak to her; and, in the bustle of the
train's arrival, we saw each other no more.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_237' id='Page_237'>237</a></span></p>

<p>I had never met Mr. Johnson, nor had any description
of his personal appearance been given me.
For some reason, I had pictured to myself a tall,
cadaverous man in a severe garb, bearing upon him
the signs of the ravages wrought by a variety of
tropical diseases; and, contrary to one's usual experience,
a gentleman roughly according with this
prognostication stepped from the train and began to
look aimlessly about him.</p>

<p>'Mr. Johnson?' I inquired, approaching him.</p>

<p>'Ah!' he replied, 'and you're from the manse!'</p>

<p>I admitted the impeachment, and we set off together
for home. On the way we chatted about the
weather, the place, the crops, the people, the church,
the services, and things in general. He was a
vivacious conversationalist, and exhibited a remarkably
alert and hungry mind. He wanted to know all
about everything; and when we discussed my own
work, its difficulties, and its encouragements, he
showed a genuine interest and a delightful sympathy.
We had invited several of the leading missionary
spirits of the congregation to meet him at
tea. In order that the conversation at table might be
generally enjoyable, I had stored my mind with a
fine assortment of questions concerning conditions
in Northern Africa which, like a quiver-full of
arrows, I intended firing at our guest as opportunity
offered. But opportunity did not offer. Mr. Johnson
was so interested in the work of the various
organizations represented round the table that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_238' id='Page_238'>238</a></span>
made it impossible for us to inquire about his own.
Moreover, our visitor chanced to discover that one
of our guests had in his home a little boy who was
afflicted with blindness. On eliciting this information,
Mr. Johnson lapsed into sudden silence, and
looked, I thought, as though he had been hurt. But,
after tea, he drew the father of the blind boy aside
and explained to him that he himself had but one
child, a little girl of ten, and she was similarly
afflicted. As he spoke of her, his vivacity vanished,
and a great depth of tenderness revealed itself. I
wondered, but did not care to ask, if the blindness
of his child was part of the price that he had been
compelled to pay for residence in tropical Africa.
After telling us of his little daughter, and of the
comfort that she was to him, Mr. Johnson looked
at his watch.</p>

<p>'We have nearly an hour,' he said, 'before meeting
time; may I peep into your sanctum? I love
to glance over a man's books.'</p>

<p>Rarely have I spent an hour in the study so delightfully.
All his enthusiasm awoke again at sight
of the shelves. He took down volume after volume,
handling each with affectionate reverence, and making
each the text of a running comment of a most
fascinating character. Amusing anecdotes about the
author; an outline of the singular circumstances
under which certain of the books were written;
illuminating criticisms by eminent authorities;
sparkling quotations of out-of-the-way passages—there
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_239' id='Page_239'>239</a></span>
seemed to be no end to his fund of lively and
original observations.</p>

<p>'But I say,' he suddenly ejaculated, 'that conversation
at table was most interesting and valuable.
I had no idea that so much excellent work was being
done. I have often wondered——'</p>

<p>But at that moment the mistress of the manse
intervened.</p>

<p>'Excuse me,' she said, as she opened the study
door, 'but Mr. McKerrow and another gentleman
wish to see you at once in the drawing-room.'</p>

<p>To the drawing-room I accordingly repaired; and
there I found my companion of the afternoon, accompanied
by a short, ruddy, thick-set man, who
was laughing very heartily.</p>

<p>'This is an extraordinary situation,' my friend
began. 'You will have discovered by this time that
we jumped to conclusions too hurriedly this afternoon.
<span class='it'>This</span> is Mr. Harriford Johnson, of the North
Africa Evangelization Society, who is, I believe, to
lecture for you to-night, and I think you must have
walked off with Mr. Douglas E. Johnson, M.A.,
who is to address our teachers this evening on the
kindergarten method as applied to Sunday-school
work. Mrs. McKerrow and I had invited the superintendent
of our Sunday-school and the teachers of
the primary classes to meet Mr. Johnson at tea at
the manse, and we got into a beautiful tangle. It
was like playing a game of cross questions and
crooked answers. The young people were asking
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_240' id='Page_240'>240</a></span>
Mr. Johnson's advice on technical matters connected
with their classes; and Mr. Johnson was modestly
disclaiming all knowledge of the subject, and was
telling us of his experiences in Central Africa. We
were all beginning to feel that the world had suddenly
turned topsy-turvy, when Mr. Johnson suddenly
asked how long ago the Young People's Missionary
Union was established, and seemed surprised
that a Miss Elsie Hammond was not present. Then
the truth broke upon us, and we have all been laughing
ever since.'</p>

<p>I cordially welcomed Mr. Johnson, and then we
all three went through to the dining-room, in which,
by this time, the whole of our party was assembled.
Mr. Johnson was holding the company spell-bound.
I briefly introduced our two visitors, and explained
the position. The announcement was received with
bursts of merriment, although our tea-table guest
was covered with confusion and full of apologies.
However, he quickly entered into the humor of the
situation, and, after promising to return to lunch
with the African Mr. Johnson next day, he went
off with Mr. McKerrow laughing heartily.</p>

<p>Both meetings were a great success. The comedy
of errors may have had something to do with it.
In comparing notes next morning, both speakers
declared that they felt very much at home with
their audiences. The joke had quickly spread, and
created an atmosphere of sympathy and familiarity.
Henry Drummond used to say that he could never
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_241' id='Page_241'>241</a></span>
get on with people until he had laughed with them.
Both meetings opened that evening with a bond
already established between speaker and audience;
and that stands for a good deal.</p>

<p>We had a very happy time, too, at lunch next
morning. Our visitors were both pleased that the
mistake had been made.</p>

<p>'It's very nice,' said Mr. Harriford Johnson, 'to
have got into touch with two ministers and two congregations
instead of one. I am thankful to have
been able to say a word for Africa to the young
people with whom I had tea at Mr. McKerrow's.'</p>

<p>'And for my part,' added Mr. Douglas Johnson,
'I am thoroughly ashamed of myself. The conversation
at the tea-table last evening was a perfect
revelation to me. I have often heard about foreign
missions, and I suppose I ought to have interested
myself in them. But one has his own line of things,
and is apt to get into grooves. I had no idea until
yesterday that the movement was so orderly and
systematic nor that the operations were so extensive.
It was like being taken into the confidence of a
military commander, and shown his strategy. I go
back feeling that my mind has been fitted with a
new set of windows, and I am able to look out upon
the world in a way that was impossible before. I
am delighted, too, to have met my namesake, Mr.
Harriford Johnson. He has given me'—taking a
pamphlet from his pocket—'a copy of the last annual
report of the North Africa Evangelization Society,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_242' id='Page_242'>242</a></span>
and I shall always think more kindly of Africa
because of this singular experience at Mosgiel.'</p>

<p>It was years before I heard of either of our
visitors again. Mr. Harriford Johnson, it is true,
posted me each year a copy of the report of his
work. In 1899, however, he enclosed the pamphlet
in a note saying that he had found some of the
hints that he had picked up in his conversation
with Mr. McKerrow's kindergarten teachers
very useful to his native school. 'There is something
in the idea,' he wrote, 'that appeals to the
African mind; and I am sending to London for
some literature on the subject with a view to applying
the system more extensively. The mistakes that
we all made that evening at the Mosgiel railway
station have proved, to me, very profitable ones.'</p>

<p>I never heard directly from Mr. Douglas Johnson.
But, about five years afterwards, I noticed in an
Auckland paper the announcement of the death of
his little blind girl; and, a year or two later, I saw
in the annual report of Mr. Harriford Johnson's
Mission the acknowledgement of a handsome
donation from D.E.J., '<span class='it'>in loving memory of one
who, though spending all her days in darkness, now
sees, and desires that Africa shall have the Light of
Life</span>.'</p>

<p>Of all the things that are made in a world like
this, mistakes are by no means the worst.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
